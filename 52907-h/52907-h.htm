<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE BEGINNING</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">It was Caroline’s birthday, and she had had
some very pleasant presents. There was a
blotting-book of blue leather (at least, it looked
like leather), with pink and purple roses
painted on it, from her younger sister Charlotte;
and a paint-box—from her brother
Charles—as good as new.</p>

<p>‘I’ve hardly used it at all,’ he said, ‘and it’s
much nicer than anything I could have bought
you with my own money, and I’ve wiped all
the paints clean.’</p>

<p>‘It’s lovely,’ said Caroline; ‘and the
beautiful brushes, too!’</p>

<p>‘Real fitch,’ said Charles proudly. ‘They’ve
got points like needles.’</p>

<p>‘Just like,’ said Caroline, putting them one
after the other into her mouth, and then
holding them up to the light.</p>

<p>Besides the paint-box and the blotting-book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
a tin-lined case had come from India, with a
set of carved chess-men from father, and from
mother some red and blue scarves, and, most
glorious of imaginable gifts, a leopard-skin.</p>

<p>‘They will brighten the play-room a little,’
said mother in her letter. And they did.</p>

<p>Aunt Emmeline had given a copy of <i>Sesame
and Lilies</i>, which is supposed to be good for
girls, though a little difficult when you are only
twelve; and Uncle Percival had presented a
grey leather pocket-book and an olive-wood
paper-knife with ‘Sorrento’ on the handle.
The cook and housemaid had given needle-book
and pin-cushion; and Miss Peckitt, the
little dressmaker who came to the house to
make the girls’ dresses, brought a small, thin
book bound in red, with little hard raised spots
like pin-heads all over it, and hoped Miss
Caroline would be kind enough to accept.</p>

<p>‘The book,’ said Miss Peckitt, ‘was mine
when a child, and my dear mother also, as a
young girl, was partial to it. Please accept it,
Miss, with my humble best wishes.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks most awfully,’ said Caroline, embracing
her.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Miss Peckitt, straightening
her collar after the sudden kiss. ‘Quite
welcome, though unexpected; I <i>had</i> a bit of
southernwood given to me this morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
which, you will find in the book, means a
surprise.’</p>

<p>And it did, for the book was <i>The Language
of Flowers</i>. And really that book was the beginning
of this story, or, at least, if it wasn’t that
book, it was the other book. But that comes
later.</p>

<p>‘It’s ripping,’ said Caroline. ‘I do like it
being red.’</p>

<p>The last present was a very large bunch of
marigolds and a halfpenny birthday-card, with
a gold anchor and pink clasped hands on it,
from the boy who did the boots and knives.</p>

<p>‘We’ll decorate our room,’ said Charlotte,
‘in honour of your birthday, Caro. We’ve
got lots of coloured things, and I’ll borrow
cook’s Sunday scarf. It’s pink and purple
shot silk—a perfect dream! I’ll fly!’</p>

<p>She flew; and on her return they decorated
their room.</p>

<p>You will perhaps wonder why they were so
anxious to decorate their room with coloured
things. It was because the house they lived
in had so little colour in it that it was more
like a print of a house in a book—all black and
white and grey, you know—than like a house
for real people to live in. It was a pale, neat,
chilly house. There was, for instance, white
straw matting on the floors instead of warm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
coloured carpets; and on the stairs a sort of
pale grey cocoa-nut matting. The window
curtains were of soft cotton, and were palely
lavender; they had no damask richness, no
gay flowery patterns. The walls were not
papered, but distempered in clean pale tints,
and the general effect was rather like that of a
very superior private hospital. The fact that the
floors were washed every week with Sanitas
gave a pleasing wood-yard scent. There were
no coloured pictures in the house—only brown
copies of great paintings by Raphael and
Velazquez and people like that.</p>

<p>The Stanmore children lived here because
their father and mother were in India and
their other relations in New Zealand—all
except old Uncle Charles, who was their
mother’s uncle and who had quarrelled with,
or been quarrelled with by, their father and
mother in bygone years.</p>

<p>The owners of the house, whose name was
Sandal, were relations of some sort—cousins,
perhaps. Though they were called Uncle
Percival and Aunt Emmeline they were not
really those relations.</p>

<p>There was one thing about this so-called
aunt and uncle—they were never cross and
seldom unjust. Their natures seemed to be
pale and calm like the colours of their house;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
and though the children had meat every day
for dinner, Mr. and Miss Sandal never had
anything but vegetables, and vegetables are
said to be calming.</p>

<p>Now India is a highly-coloured country, as
you may have noticed in pictures, and the
Stanmore children felt faded in that grey
house. And that is why they loved colour so
much, and made so much fuss about the
leopard-skin and the Indian embroideries and
the marigold flowers and the little old red
book and the wreath of gold forget-me-nots
outside it encircling the words <i>Language of
Flowers</i>.</p>

<p>‘When Aunt Emmeline sees how beautiful
it is she’ll want to have the whole house
scarved and leoparded, I shouldn’t wonder,’
said Charlotte, hanging the pink scarf over a
picture of a blind girl sitting on an orange,
which is called ‘Hope.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose so,’ said Caroline. ‘I
asked her once what old Uncle Charles’s house
was like, that mother said was so beautiful,
and she said it was far too full of things, and
somewhat imperfectly ventilated.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a pity Uncle Charles was quarrelled
with, <i>I</i> think,’ said Charlotte. ‘I shouldn’t at
all have minded going to stay with him. I
expect really he likes nice little girls. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wonder what the row was all about, and why
they didn’t all kiss and be friends before the
sun went down upon—like <i>we’re</i> told to?’</p>

<p>I cannot tell you what the row was about,
for I know no more than you do, or than
Charlotte did. And you must have noticed
that grown-up people’s quarrels are very large
and most mysterious. When you quarrel with
your brothers or sisters it is always about some
simple thing—as, for instance, who left your
paint-brushes in the water, or who forgot your
<i>Water Babies</i> out in the hayfield, or whether
it was you who upset the gum over your
brother’s map, or walked on the doll’s house
sofa that day when you all upset it scrapping,
and the furniture was put back in a hurry.
Anyhow, your quarrels are soon over, because
quarrelling is so uncomfortable, and, besides,
you have most likely been taught, as Charlotte
had, that you must not let the sun go down
upon your wrath. But with grown-up people
it is different. They seem sometimes to have
forgotten about the sun not going down, and
their quarrels last on and on and on for weeks
and months and years, till you would think that
they must have forgotten what the fuss was all
about. But they don’t, and when Aunt Jane
comes to tea you will still hear fragments about
how Uncle William behaved, and what a pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
it was about Edward acting as he did. If the
grown-ups notice you, they will tell you to run
away and play. You will never hear what the
quarrel was about, and if you did you wouldn’t
understand, and if you understood you’d probably
think it was a silly fuss about nothing,
and wonder how they could have kept it up all
these years—for it is as likely as not that Uncle
William did that unfortunate behaving of his
many many years ago, and that Edward acted
in that extraordinary way long before you were
born. The only thing you can find out for
certain about these grown-up quarrels is that
they seem to be always about money, or about
people having married people that their relations
didn’t want them to marry.</p>

<p>No doubt you will have noticed all this, and
you will perhaps have noticed as well that
if you suddenly speak of a person, that person
very often turns up almost at once. So that
when Charlotte said, ‘I wish Uncle Charles
had not been quarrelled with,’ it would have
occasioned you no surprise if Uncle Charles had
suddenly walked up to the front door.</p>

<p>But this did not happen. But some one
walked up to the front door. It was the
postman.</p>

<p>Caroline rushed out to see if there were any
more birthday-cards for her. It was now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
beginning of the summer holidays, but some of
the girls at the High School might possibly have
remembered her birthday. So she rushed out,
and rushed into Aunt Emmeline, who must
have been hurt, because afterwards Caroline’s
head was quite sore where it had banged
against Aunt Emmeline’s mother-of-pearl waist-buckle.
But Aunt Emmeline only said:</p>

<p>‘Gently, my child, gently,’ which, as Caroline
said later, was worse than being scolded, and
made you feel as if you were elephants. And
there weren’t any birthday-cards for her, either.</p>

<p>All the letters were for Miss Sandal. And
just as the leopard-skin had been spread on the
floor she came to the door of the children’s
room with one of the letters in her hand.</p>

<p>‘I have a surprise for you,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Do come in and sit down,’ said Caroline.
That was another nice thing about Aunt
Emmeline. She always treated the children’s
room as though it really was the children’s
room, and expected to be treated as a visitor
when she came into it. She never sat down
without being asked.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she now said, and sat down.
‘The surprise is that you are going into the
country for your holidays.’</p>

<p>There was a silence, only broken by Charles,
and he only said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We needn’t have bothered about decorating
the room.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, is this decoration?’ Miss Sandal
asked, as though she thought pink scarves
might get on to picture-frames and leopard-skins
on to floors, or marigolds on to mantelpieces,
just by accident or untidiness.</p>

<p>‘I may say that I have known for some time
that this was likely to happen—but the letter
which has just come makes everything settled.
You are to go the day after to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘But <i>where?</i>’ Caroline asked. And Miss
Sandal then uttered the memorable and
unusual words, ‘Did you ever hear of your
Great-Uncle Charles?’</p>

<p>‘The one that was quarrelled with?’ said
Charles.</p>

<p>‘I did not know you knew of that. Yes.
The quarrel is now at an end, and he has
invited you to spend your holidays at the
Manor House.’</p>

<p>There was a deep silence, due to the
children’s wanting to shout ‘Hooray!’ and
feeling that it would not be manners.</p>

<p>‘I thought you’d be pleased,’ said Miss
Sandal. ‘It is considered a very beautiful
house, and stands in a park.’</p>

<p>‘Are you going, Aunt Emmeline?’ Caroline
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, dear. Only you children are invited.
You will be quiet and gentle, won’t you, and
try to remember that your Great-Uncle Charles
is a quiet student, and not used to children.
You will have a great deal of liberty, and I
hope you will use it well. You have never
been on a visit before without—without some
one to remind you of—to tell you——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s all right, Aunt Emmie,’ said
Charlotte. ‘But who’ll sew on our buttons
and mend our stockings?’</p>

<p>‘There is a housekeeper, of course,’ said
Miss Sandal. ‘I shall pack your things to-morrow;
and if you will decide what toys you
would like to take with you, I will pack them
too.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Caroline, still feeling it polite
not to look pleased. ‘Thank you, Aunt
Emmeline.’</p>

<p>‘I hope he’ll like us,’ said Charles. ‘He
ought to when we’re all named after him. I
say, couldn’t we all pretend to be called something
else? It’s bad enough now; but it’ll be
awful when there’s an Uncle Charles in the
house as well as all us. I say, Aunt Emmie,
are we to call him “Great”?’</p>

<p>‘He means Great-Uncle Charles,’ Caroline
explained. ‘I expect we’d better call him
plain “Uncle,” hadn’t we?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>‘He wouldn’t like being called “plain,”’
said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Don’t be silly,’ said Caroline, still a prey to
politeness. ‘He won’t mind what little boys
call him.’</p>

<p>‘I bet he would if I called him the sort of
things you call me. Silly yourself!’</p>

<p>‘Children! children!’ said Miss Sandal. ‘I
thought you’d be so pleased.’</p>

<p>‘We <i>are</i>,’ said Caroline. ‘Only won’t you
be rather dull without us? That’s why we
don’t seem so glad as you seem to think we
ought to seem.’</p>

<p>Miss Sandal smiled, which made her long,
whitey-brown-paper-coloured face look much
prettier.</p>

<p>‘Thank you, Caroline. Your Uncle Percival
and I are also about to take a holiday.
We are going to Switzerland, the Italian Lakes,
and to Venice. You may be as happy as you
like without worrying about us.’</p>

<p>And it was then that the three children
felt that politeness and sincerity might meet
in a heartfelt shout of ‘Hooray!’</p>

<p>‘I shall take the leopard-skin and all my
other presents,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘And I shall take the draughts and the
spilikins,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Mother said there were draughts made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
ebony and ivory with lions’ heads and mother-of-pearl
spilikins in the drawing-room when
she was a little girl,’ Caroline reminded her.</p>

<p>‘I shall take every single thing I’ve got,
and my cricket set as well,’ said Charles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>THE MANOR HOUSE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> can imagine the packing, the running up
and down stairs, the difficulty of choosing what
to leave behind—for that is, after all, what it
comes to when you are going away, much
more than the difficulty of choosing what you
will take with you. Miss Sandal, surrounded
by heaps of toys and books—far too large to
have been got into the trunks, even if all the
clothes had been left out—at last settled the
question by promising to send on, by post or
by carrier, any little thing which had been left
behind and which the children should all agree
was necessary to their happiness. ‘And the
leopard-skin takes so much room,’ she said,
‘and I believe there are wild-beast-skins as
well as stuffed animals at your uncle’s house.’
So they left the leopard-skin behind too.
There was a good deal of whispered talk and
mystery and consulting of books that morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and Aunt Emmeline most likely wondered
what it was all about. But perhaps she didn’t.
She was very calm. Anyway, she must have
known when, as the cab drew up in front of
the door, the three children presented themselves
before her with bouquets in their hands.</p>

<p>‘They are for you,’ said all three at once.</p>

<p>Then Charlotte presented Aunt Emmeline
with a bunch of balm from the garden.</p>

<p>‘It means sympathy,’ she said; ‘because,
of course, it’s nice of you to say so, but we
know that those geography places you’re going
to can’t be <i>really</i> as nice as Uncle Charles’s.’</p>

<p>Charles’s bouquet was of convolvulus. ‘It
means dead hope,’ he explained; ‘but it’s very
pretty, too. And here’s this.’ He suddenly
presented a tiny cactus in a red pot. ‘I bought
it for you,’ he said; ‘it means, “Thou leavest
not.”’</p>

<p>‘How charming of you!’ said Aunt Emmeline,
and turned to Caroline, who was almost hidden
behind a huge bunch of ivy and marigolds.</p>

<p>‘The ivy means friendship,’ said Caroline,
‘and the marigolds don’t count. I only put
them because they are so goldy-bright. But
if they <i>must</i> count, then they mean cruelty—Fate’s,
you know, because you’re not coming.
And there’s a purple pansy in among it somewhere,
because that means, “I think of you.”’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/i_026.jpg" width="376" height="585" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>There was a good deal of whispered talk and mystery.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a><br /><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Thank you very, very much,’ said Aunt
Emmeline. ‘I can’t tell you how pleased I
am. It is very sweet of you all.’</p>

<p>This floral presentation gave a glow and
glory to their departure. At the very last
moment Caroline leaned out of the window
to say:</p>

<p>‘Oh, Aunt Emmeline, when Miss Peckitt
comes to finish those muslin frocks that you’re
going to send us, <i>would</i> you try to manage to
give her a Canterbury bell from me? She’ll
know what it means. But in case she doesn’t,
it’s gratitude—in the book. And we’ll put
flowers in our letters expressing our feelings.
Good-bye.’</p>

<p>Uncle Percival took them to the station
and——</p>

<p>But why should I describe a railway journey?
You know exactly what it is like. I will only
say that it was very dusty, and so sunny that
the children wanted the blinds down, only a
very tailor-made lady with a cross little grey
dog said ‘No.’ And you know how black
your hands get in the train, and how gritty the
cushions are, and how your faces get black too,
though you are quite certain you haven’t touched
them with your hands. The one who got the
little bit of the engine in its eye was Charles
that time. But some one always gets it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
because some one always puts its head out of
the carriage window, no matter what the printed
notices may say. You know all this. What
you don’t know is what happened at the junction
where, carefully attended by the guard,
they changed trains. They had to wait for
some time, and when they had looked at the
bookstall—which was small and dull, and
almost entirely newspapers—they looked at the
other people who had to wait too. Most of
them were of dull appearance; but there was
one tall gentleman who looked, they all agreed,
exactly like Mr. Murdstone in <i>David Copperfield</i>.</p>

<p>‘And he’s got David with him, too,’ said
Charlotte. ‘Look!’</p>

<p>The Murdstone gentleman, having bought
the <i>Athenæum</i>, the <i>Spectator</i>, and a seven-penny
reprint of the works of Marcus Aurelius,
had gone to a bench on which sat a sulky-looking
boy. He spoke to the boy, and the boy
answered. And the gentleman walked off.</p>

<p>‘He’s gone to have a bun all by himself,’
said Charles. ‘Selfish pig!’</p>

<p>‘I say, let’s sit down on the bench. You sit
next him, Charles. Perhaps he’d talk to us.’
This was Caroline’s idea.</p>

<p>They did; and ‘he,’ who was, of course, the
sulky boy, did speak to them. But not till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a><br /><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
they’d spoken to him. It was Charles who
did it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i_030.jpg" width="383" height="591" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>‘You sit next him, Charles.’</p></div>
</div>

<p>‘Are you going on in this next train?’ he
said, ‘because, if you are, we can get into your
carriage. We shall be company for you.’</p>

<p>‘What’s the good?’ said the boy, unexpectedly;
‘it’ll only make it worse afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘What worse?’</p>

<p>‘The being alone.’</p>

<p>‘Well, anyhow,’ said Caroline, coming round
to sit on the other side of him, ‘you’re not alone
now. What’s up? Who is <i>he?</i>’</p>

<p>‘He’s a schoolmaster. I should have thought
you could have seen that.’</p>

<p>‘We thought he was like Mr. Murdstone.’</p>

<p>‘He is,’ said the strange boy; ‘exactly.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Charlotte joyously, ‘then you’ve
read <i>David</i>. I say!’</p>

<p>They were all delighted. There is no bond
like the bond of having read and liked the
same books. A tide of friendliness swept over
the party, and when they found that he had
also read <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, <i>Wild Animals
I Have Known</i>, and <i>Hereward the Wake</i>, as
well as E. Nesbit’s stories for children in the
<i>Strand Magazine</i>, they all felt that they had
been friends for years.</p>

<p>‘But tell us all about it, quick, before <i>he</i>
comes back,’ urged Charles. ‘Perhaps we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
could help you—bring you jam tarts and
apples with a rope ladder or something.
We are yours to the death—you won’t forget
that, will you? And what’s your name? And
where do you live? And where are you
going? Tell us all about it, quick!’ he
urged.</p>

<p>Then out it all came. The strange boy’s
name was Rupert Wix, and he was at a school—not
half bad the school was—and old Filon—he
was the classical chap—was going to take
Rupert and two other chaps to Wales for the
holidays—and now the other chaps had got
measles, and so had old Filon. And old
Mug’s brother—his name wasn’t really Mug,
of course, but Macpherson, and the brother
was the Rev. William Macpherson—yes, that
was him, the Murdstone chap—he was going
to take Rupert to his beastly school in the
country.</p>

<p>‘And there won’t be any other chaps,’ said
Rupert, ‘because, of course, it’s vac—just old
Mug’s beastly brother and me, for days and
weeks and years—until the rest of the school
comes back. I wish I was dead!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t!’ said Caroline; ‘how dreadful!
They’ve got scarlet fever at <i>our</i> school, that’s
why our holidays have begun so early. Do
cheer up! Have some nut-chocolate.’ A brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
struggle with her pocket ended in the appearance
of a packet—rather worn at the edges—the
parting gift of Aunt Emmeline.</p>

<p>‘Is old Mug’s brother as great a pig as
he looks?’ Charles asked, through Rupert’s
‘Thank-yous.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Much</i> greater,’ said Rupert cordially.</p>

<p>‘Then I know what I’d do,’ said Charlotte.
‘I’d run away from school, like a hero in a
book, and have some adventures, and then go
home to my people.’</p>

<p>‘That’s just it,’ said Rupert. ‘I haven’t
got anywhere to run to. My people are in
India. That’s why I have to have my hols at
a beastly school. I’d rather be a dog in a
kennel—much.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, so would I,’ said Charlotte. ‘But
then I’d almost rather be a dog than anything.
They’re such dears. I do hope
there’ll be dogs where we’re going to.’</p>

<p>‘Where’s that?’ Rupert asked, more out
of politeness than because he wanted to
know.</p>

<p>‘I’ll write it down for you,’ said Caroline,
and did, on a page of the new grey leather
pocket-book Uncle Percival had given her.
‘Here, put it in your pocket, and you write
and tell us what happens. Perhaps it won’t
be so bad. Here he comes—quick!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>She stuffed the paper into Rupert’s jacket
pocket as the tall Murdstone-like figure
advanced towards them. The three children
left Rupert and walked up the platform.</p>

<p>‘I’m glad we gave him the chock,’ said
Charles, and the word was hardly out of his
mouth before a cold, hard hand touched his
shoulder (and his cheek as he turned quickly)
and a cold, hard voice said:</p>

<p>‘Little boy, I do not allow those under
my charge to accept sweetmeats from strange
children, especially dirty ones.’</p>

<p>And with that the Murdstone gentleman
pushed the chocolate into Charles’s hand and
went back to his prey.</p>

<p>‘Beast! Brute! Beast!’ said Charles.</p>

<p>After this it was mere forlorn-hopishness
and die-on-the-barricade courage, as Charlotte
said later, that made the children get into
the same carriage with Rupert and his captor.
They might as well have saved themselves the
trouble. The Murdstone gentleman put Rupert
in a corner and sat in front of him with a
newspaper very widely opened. And at the
next station he changed carriages, taking
Rupert by the hand as though he had been, as
Charles put it, ‘any old baby-girl.’</p>

<p>But as Rupert went out Caroline whispered
to him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You get some borage and eat it,’ and
Rupert looked ‘Why?’</p>

<p>‘Borage gives courage, you know,’ she said,
too late, for he was whisked away before he
could hear her, and they saw him no more.</p>

<p>They talked about him, though, till the
train stopped at East Farleigh, which was their
station.</p>

<p>There was a waggonette to meet them and a
cart for their luggage, and the coachman said
he would have known Caroline anywhere,
because she was so like her mother, whom he
remembered when he was only gardener’s boy;
and this made every one feel pleasantly as
though they were going home.</p>

<p>It was a jolly drive, across the beautiful
bridge and up the hill and through the village
and along a mile or more of road, where the
green hedges were powdered with dust, and
tufts of hay hung, caught by the brambles from
the tops of passing waggons. These bits of
hay made one feel that one really was in the
country—not just the bare field-country of the
suburb where Aunt Emmeline and Uncle
Percival lived, where one could never get
away from the sight of red and yellow brick
villas.</p>

<p>And then the boy who was driving the
luggage cart got down and opened a gate; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
they drove through and along a woodland road
where ferns and blossoming brambles grew
under trees very green and not dusty at all.</p>

<p>From the wood they came to a smooth,
green, grassy park dotted with trees, and in
the middle of it, standing in a half-circle of
chestnuts and sycamores, was the house.</p>

<p>It was a white, bow-windowed house, with
a balcony at one end, and a porch, with white
pillars and two broad steps; and the grass
grew right up to the very doorsteps, which is
unusual and very pretty. There was not a
flower to be seen—only grass. The waggonette,
of course, kept to the drive, which ran
round to a side door—half glass.</p>

<p>And here Mrs. Wilmington the housekeeper
received them. She was a pale, thin
person—quite kind, but not at all friendly.</p>

<p>‘I don’t think she has time to think of
anything but being ladylike,’ said Charlotte.
‘She ought to wear mittens.’</p>

<p>This was while they were washing their
hands for tea.</p>

<p>‘I suppose if you’re a housekeeper you
have to be careful people don’t think you’re a
servant,’ said Caroline. ‘What drivel it is!
I say, isn’t this something like?’</p>

<p>She was looking out of the bow window
of the big room spread with a blue rose-patterned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
carpet, at the green glory of the
park, lying in the sun like another and much
more beautiful carpet with a pattern of trees
on it.</p>

<p>Then they went down to tea. Such a house—full
of beautiful things! But the children
hadn’t time to look at them then, and I haven’t
time to tell you about them now.</p>

<p>I will only say that the dining-room was
perfect in its Turkey-carpet-and-mahogany
comfort, and that it had red curtains.</p>

<p>‘Will you please pour the tea, Miss Caroline?’
said Mrs. Wilmington, and went away.</p>

<p>‘I’m glad we haven’t got to have tea with
<i>her</i>, anyway,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>And then Uncle Charles came in. He was
not at all what they expected. He could not
have been what anybody expected. He was
more shadowy than you would think anybody
could be. He was more like a lightly printed
photograph from an insufficiently exposed and
imperfectly developed negative than anything
else I can think of. He was as thin and pale
as Mrs. Wilmington, but there was nothing
hard or bony about him. He was soft as a
shadow—his voice, his hand, his eyes.</p>

<p>‘And what are your names?’ he said, when
he had shaken hands all round.</p>

<p>Caroline told him, and Charles added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>‘How funny of you not to know, uncle,
when we’re all named after you!’</p>

<p>‘Caroline, Charles, Charlotte,’ he repeated.
‘Yes, I suppose you are. I like my tea very
weak, please, with plenty of milk and no sugar.’</p>

<p>Caroline nervously clattered among the
silver and china. She was not used to pouring
out real tea for long-estranged uncles.</p>

<p>‘I hope you will enjoy yourselves here,’
said Uncle Charles, taking his cup; ‘and excuse
me if I do not always join you at meals. I am
engaged on a work—I mean I am writing a
book,’ he told them.</p>

<p>‘What fun!’ said every one but Caroline,
who had just burnt herself with the urn; and
Charles added:</p>

<p>‘What’s it about?’</p>

<p>‘Magic,’ said the Uncle, ‘or, rather, a
branch of magic. I thought of calling it “A
Brief Consideration of the Psychological and
Physiological Part played by Suggestion in
So-called Magic.”’</p>

<p>‘It sounds interesting; at least I know it
would if I knew anything about it,’ said Caroline,
trying to be both truthful and polite.</p>

<p>‘It’s very long,’ said Charles. ‘How would
you get all that printed on the book’s back?’</p>

<p>‘And don’t say “so-called,”’ said Charlotte.
‘It looks as if you didn’t believe in magic.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>‘If people thought I believed in magic they
wouldn’t read my books,’ said Uncle Charles.
‘They’d think I was mad, you know.’</p>

<p>‘But why?’ Charlotte asked. ‘<i>We</i> aren’t
mad, and we believe in it. Do you know any
spells, uncle? We want awfully to try a spell.
It’s the dream of our life. It is, really.’</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile moved the oyster-shell-coloured
face of Uncle Charles.</p>

<p>‘So you take an interest in magic?’ he said.
‘We shall have at least that in common.’</p>

<p>‘Of course we do. Every one does, only
they’re afraid to say so. Even servants do.
They tell fortunes and dreams. Did you ever
read about the Amulet, or the Phœnix, or the
Words of Power? Bread and butter, please,’
said Charles.</p>

<p>‘You have evidently got up the subject,’
said Uncle Charles. ‘Who told you about
Words of Power?’</p>

<p>‘It’s in <i>The Amulet</i>,’ said Charlotte. ‘I
say, uncle, do tell us some spells.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ Uncle Charles sighed. ‘I am afraid
the day of spells has gone by—except, perhaps,
for people of your age. <i>She</i> could have told
you spells enough—if all the stories of her are
true.’</p>

<p>He pointed to a picture over the mantelpiece—a
fair-haired, dark-eyed lady in a ruff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>‘She was an ancestress of ours,’ he said;
‘she was wonderfully learned.’</p>

<p>‘What became of her?’ Charlotte asked.</p>

<p>‘They burned her for a witch. It is sometimes
a mistake to know too much,’ said the
Uncle.</p>

<p>This contrasted agreeably with remembered
remarks of Uncle Percival and Aunt Emmeline,
such as ‘Knowledge is power’ and ‘There is
no darkness but ignorance.’</p>

<p>The children looked at the lady in the
white ruff and black velvet dress, and they
liked her face.</p>

<p>‘What a shame!’ they said.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the Uncle. ‘You see she’s
resting her hand on two books. There’s a
tradition that those books contain her magic
secret. I used to look for the books when I
was young, but I never found them—I never
found them.’ He sighed again.</p>

<p>‘<i>We’ll</i> look, uncle,’ said Charlotte eagerly.
‘We <i>may</i> look, mayn’t we? Young heads are
better than old shoulders, aren’t they? At
least, that sounds rude, but you know I mean
two heads are better than yours—— No,
that’s not it. Too many cooks spoil the—— No,
that’s not it either. We wouldn’t spoil
anything. Too many hands make light work.
<i>That’s</i> what I meant.’</p>

<p>‘Your meaning was plain from the first,’
said the Uncle, finishing his tea and setting
down his cup—a beautiful red and blue and
gold one—very different from Aunt Emmeline’s
white crockery. ‘Certainly you may
look. But you’ll respect the field of your
search.’</p>

<p>‘Uncle,’ said Caroline, from behind the
silver tea-tray, ‘your house is the most lovely,
splendid, glorious, beautiful house we’ve ever
seen, and——’</p>

<p>‘We wouldn’t hurt a hair of its head,’ said
Charles.</p>

<p>Again the Uncle smiled. ‘Well, well,’ he
said, and faded away like a shadow.</p>

<p>‘We’ll find those books or perish,’ said
Charlotte firmly.</p>

<p>‘Ra-<i>ther</i>,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘We’ll look for them, anyway,’ said Caroline.
‘Now let’s go and pick an ivy leaf and put it
in a letter for poor dear Aunt Emmeline. I’ll
tell you something.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said the others.</p>

<p>‘This is the sort of house I’ve always
dreamed of when it said luxury—in books,
you know.’</p>

<p>‘Me too,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘<i>And</i> me,’ said Charles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE WONDERFUL GARDEN</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was very glorious to wake up the next
morning in enormous soft beds—four-posted,
with many-folded silk hangings, and shiny
furniture that reflected the sunlight as dark
mirrors might do. And breakfast was nice,
with different sorts of things to eat, in silver
dishes with spirit-lamps under them,—bacon
and sausages and scrambled eggs, and as
much toast and marmalade as you wanted;
not just porridge and apples, as at Aunt
Emmeline’s. There were tea and coffee and
hot milk. They all chose hot milk.</p>

<p>‘I feel,’ said Caroline, pouring it out of a
big silver jug with little bits of ivory between
the handle and the jug to keep the handle
from getting too hot, ‘I feel that we’re going
to enjoy every second of the time we’re here.’</p>

<p>‘Rather,’ said Charles, through sausage.
‘Isn’t Uncle Charles a dear,’ he added more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
distinctly. ‘I dreamed about him last night—that
he painted his face out of the paint-box
I gave Caro, and then we blew him out with
the bellows to make him fatter.’</p>

<p>‘And did it?’ Caroline asked.</p>

<p>‘He burst,’ said Charles briefly, ‘and turned
into showers of dead leaves.’</p>

<p>There was an interval of contented silence.
Then—</p>

<p>‘What shall we do first?’ said Charles.
And his sisters with one voice answered,
‘Explore, of course.’</p>

<p>And they finished their breakfast to dreams
of exploring every hole and corner of the
wonderful house.</p>

<p>But when they rang to have breakfast
taken away it was Mrs. Wilmington who
appeared.</p>

<p>‘Your uncle desired me to say that he
thinks it’s healthy for you to spend some hours
in the hopen—<i>o</i>pen air,’ she said, speaking in
a small distinct voice. ‘He himself takes the
air of an afternoon. So will you please all go
out at once,’ she ended in a burst of naturalness,
‘and not come ’ome, <i>h</i>ome, till one o’clock.’</p>

<p>‘Where are we to go?’ asked Charlotte,
not pleased.</p>

<p>‘Not beyond the park and grounds,’ said the
housekeeper. ‘And,’ she added reluctantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
‘Mr. Charles said if there was any pudding
you liked to mention——’</p>

<p>A brief consultation ended in, ‘Treacle hat,
please’; and when Mrs. Wilmington had
minced off, they turned to each other and said:</p>

<p>‘The brick!’</p>

<p>‘The old duck!’ and</p>

<p>‘Something like an uncle.’</p>

<p>Then they went out, as they had been told
to do. And they took off their shoes and
stockings, which they had not been told to do—but,
on the other hand, had not been told not
to—and walked barefooted in the grass still
cool and dewy under the trees. And they put
on their boots again and explored the park,
and explored the stable-yard, where a groom
was rubbing bright the silver buckles of the
harness and whistling as he rubbed. They
explored the stables and the harness-room and
the straw-loft and the hay-loft. And then they
went back to the park and climbed trees—a
little way, because though they had always
known that they would climb trees if ever they
had half a chance, they had not, till now, had
any chance at all.</p>

<p>And all the while they were doing all this
they were looking—at the back of their minds,
even when they weren’t doing it with the part
you think with—for the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>And there wasn’t any garden!</p>

<p>That was the plain fact that they had to face
after two hours of sunshine and green out-of-doors.</p>

<p>‘And I’m certain mother said there was a
garden,’ Caroline said, sitting down suddenly
on the grass; ‘a beautiful garden and a
terrace.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps the Uncle didn’t like it, and he’s
had it made not garden again—“Going back
to Nature” that would be, like Aunt Emmeline
talks about,’ Charles suggested.</p>

<p>‘And it’s dreadful if there’s no garden,’ said
Caroline, ‘because of the flowers we were
going to send in letters. Wild flowers don’t
have such deep meanings, I’m certain.’</p>

<p>‘And besides we haven’t seen any wild
flowers,’ said Caroline. ‘Oh, bother!’</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ Charles said, ‘think of exploring
the house—and finding the book, perhaps.
We’ll ask the Elegant One, when we go in,
why there isn’t a garden.’</p>

<p>‘We won’t wait till then,’ said Charlotte;
‘let’s go and ask that jolly man who’s polishing
the harness. He looked as if he wouldn’t mind
us talking to him.’</p>

<p>‘It was him drove us yesterday,’ Charles
pointed out.</p>

<p>So they went as to an old friend. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
when they asked William why there wasn’t a
garden he answered surprisingly and rather
indignantly:</p>

<p>‘Ain’t they shown you, Miss? Not a
garden? There ain’t a garden to beat it hereabouts.
Come on, I’ll show you.’</p>

<p>And, still more surprisingly, he led the way
to the back door.</p>

<p>‘We aren’t to go indoors till dinner-time,’
said Caroline; ‘and besides, we <i>should</i> like to
see the garden—if there really is one.’</p>

<p>‘Of course there is one, Miss,’ said William.
‘She’ll never see you if you’re quick. She’ll
be in her room by now—at her accounts and
things. And the Master’s never about in these
back parts in the morning.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose it’s a lock-up garden and he’s
going to get the key,’ said Charles in a
whisper. But William wasn’t.</p>

<p>He led them into a whitewashed passage
that had cupboards and larders opening out
of it and ended in a green baize door. He
opened this, and there they were in the hall.</p>

<p>‘Quick,’ he said, and crossed it, unlatched
another door and held it open. ‘Come in
quiet,’ he said, and closed the door again. And
there they all were in a little square room with
a stone staircase going down the very middle
of it, like a well. There was a wooden railing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
round three sides of the stairway, and nothing
else in the room at all, except William and
the children.</p>

<p>‘A secret staircase,’ said Charlotte. ‘Oh,
it can’t be, really. How <i>lovely!</i>’</p>

<p>‘I daresay it was a secret once,’ said
William, striking a match and lighting a candle
that stood at the top of the stairs in a brass
candlestick. ‘You see there wasn’t always
these banisters, and you can see that ridge
along the wall. My grandfather says it used
to be boarded over and that’s where the joists
went. They’d have a trap-door or something
over the stairway, I shouldn’t be surprised.’</p>

<p>‘But what’s the stair for?—Where does it
<i>go?</i> Are we going down?’ the children asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes, and sharp too. Nobody’s supposed
to go this way except the Master. But you’ll
not tell on me. I’ll go first. Mind the steps,
Miss. They’re a bit wore at the edges, like.’</p>

<p>They minded the steps, going carefully
down, following the blinking, winking, blue and
yellow gleam of the candle.</p>

<p>There were not many steps.</p>

<p>‘Straight ahead now,’ said William, holding
the candle up to show the groined roof of a
long straight passage, built of stone, and with
stone flags for the floor of it.</p>

<p>‘How perfectly ripping!’ said Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
breathlessly. ‘It <i>is</i> brickish of you to bring
us here. Where does it go to?’</p>

<p>‘You wait a bit,’ said William, and went on.
The passage ended in another flight of steps—up
this time,—and the steps ended in a door,
and when William had opened this every one
blinked and shut their eyes, for the doorway
framed green leaves with blue sky showing
through them, and——</p>

<p>‘’Ere’s the garden,’ said William; and here,
indeed, it was.</p>

<p>‘There’s another door the other end what
the gardeners go in and out of,’ said William.
‘I’ll get you a key sometime.’</p>

<p>The door had opened into a sort of arch—an
arbour, for its entrance was almost veiled
by thick-growing shrubs.</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you,’ said Caroline; ‘but when
did they make this passage, and what for?’</p>

<p>‘They made that passage when the folks in
the house was too grand to go through the
stable-yard and too lazy to go round,’ said
William. ‘There’s no stable-yard way now,’
he added. ‘So long! I must be getting back,
Miss. Don’t you let on as I brought you
through.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ every one said. Charles
added, ‘But I didn’t know the house was as
old as secret passages in history times.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s any age you please,’ said William;
‘the back parts is.’</p>

<p>He went back through the door, and the
children went out through the leafy screen in
front, into the most beautiful garden that could
be, with a wall. I like unwalled gardens
myself, with views from the terraces. From
this garden you could see nothing but tall trees
and—the garden itself.</p>

<p>The lower half was a vegetable garden
arranged in squares with dwarf fruit-trees and
flower-borders round them, like the borders
round old-fashioned pocket-handkerchiefs.
Then about half-way up the garden came steps—stone
balustrades, a terrace, and beyond that
a flower garden with smooth green turf paths,
box-edged, a sundial in the middle, and in the
flower-beds flowers—more flowers than I could
give names to.</p>

<p>‘How perfectly perfect!’ Charlotte said.</p>

<p>‘I do wish I’d brought out my <i>Language
Of!</i>’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘How awfully tidy everything is!’ said
Charles in awe-struck tones.</p>

<p>It was.</p>

<p>There was nowhere an imperfect leaf, a
deformed bud, or a misshapen flower. Every
plant grew straight and strong, and with an
extraordinary evenness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>‘They look like pictures of plants more
than like real ones,’ said Caroline quite truly.</p>

<p>An old gardener was sweeping the terrace
steps, and gave the children ‘Good
morning.’</p>

<p>They gave it back, and stayed to watch him.
It seemed polite to say something before turning
away. So Caroline said:</p>

<p>‘How beautifully everything grows here.’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ said the old man, ‘it do. Say perfect
and you won’t be far out.’</p>

<p>‘It’s very clever of you,’ said Charlotte.
‘Ill weeds don’t grow in a single place in <i>your</i>
garden.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t say as I don’t do something,’ said
the old man, ‘but seems as if there was a blessing
on the place—everything thrives and grows
just-so. It’s the soil or the aspick, p’raps. I
dunno. An’ I’ve noticed things.’</p>

<p>‘What things?’ was the natural question.</p>

<p>‘Oh, just things,’ the gardener answered
shortly, and swept away to the end of the long
steps.</p>

<p>‘I say’—Caroline went after him to do it—‘I
say, may we pick the flowers?’</p>

<p>‘In moderation,’ said the gardener, and went
away.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="375" height="603" alt="children looking in garden" />
<div class="caption">‘How beautifully everything grows here.’</div>
</div>

<p>‘I wonder what he’d call moderation,’ said
Charles; and they discussed this question so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a><br /><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
earnestly that the dinner-bell rang before they
had picked any flowers at all.</p>

<p>The gate at the end of the garden was open,
and they went out that way. Over the gate
was a stone with words and a date. They
stopped to spell out the carved letters:</p>

<p class="center">
<small>HERE BE DREAMES</small><br />
<br />
1589<br />
<br />
<small>RESPICE FINEM.</small><br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">Caroline copied the last two words in the
grey-covered pocket-book; and when Mrs.
Wilmington came in to carve the mutton,
Caroline asked what the words meant.</p>

<p>‘I never inquired,’ said the housekeeper.
‘It must be quite out of date now, whatever it
meant once. But you must have been in the
garden to see that. How did you get in?’</p>

<p>An awkward question. There was nothing
for it but to say:</p>

<p>‘By the secret passage.’ And Charles said
it.</p>

<p>‘No one uses that but your uncle,’ said
Mrs. Wilmington, ‘and you were requested to
keep out of doors till dinner-time.’</p>

<p>She shut her mouth with a snap and went
on carving.</p>

<p>‘Sorry,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Granted,’ said Mrs. Wilmington, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cordially; and having placed two slices of
mutton on each plate went away.</p>

<p>‘It <i>is</i> jolly having meals by ourselves,’ said
Charlotte; ‘only I wish she wasn’t cross.’</p>

<p>‘We ought to be extra manner-y, I expect,
when we’re by ourselves,’ said Caroline. ‘May
I pass you the salt, Charles?’</p>

<p>‘No, you mayn’t,’ said Charles. ‘Thank
you, I mean; but there’s one at each corner.
That’s one each for us, and one over for——’</p>

<p>‘For <i>her</i>.’ Charlotte pointed to the picture
of the dark-eyed, fair-haired lady.</p>

<p>‘Let’s put a chair for her,’ said Charlotte,
‘and pretend she’s come to dinner. Then
we shall have to behave like grown-up
people.’</p>

<p>‘I never can remember about behaving,’
said Charles wearily; ‘such a lot of things—and
none of them seem to matter. Why
shouldn’t you drink with your mouth full? It’s
your own mouth.’</p>

<p>‘And eating peas with your knife. I think
it would be as good as conjuring, doing it
without cutting yourself’—Charlotte tried to
lift the peas from her plate with her knife—‘let
alone the balancing,’ she added, as they
rolled off among the mutton.</p>

<p>‘Don’t,’ said Caroline. ‘She’s looking at
you. Charles, you’re the only gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
worse luck—I wish I was a boy—put a chair
for her.’</p>

<p>And a large green-seated chair, whose
mahogany back was inlaid with a brass scroll
pattern, was wheeled to the empty space on
the fourth side of the table.</p>

<p>‘Now we must none of us look at her—in the
picture, I mean. And then we can’t be sure
that she isn’t sitting in that chair,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>After dinner Caroline looked up ‘Remorse’s
regret’ in <i>The Language of Flowers</i>. It was
agreed that Mrs. Wilmington had better have
a bouquet.</p>

<p>‘Brambles,’ Caroline said, her finger in the
book, ‘they’re Remorse—but they wouldn’t
make a very comfortable nosegay. And Regret’s
verbena, and I don’t even know what
it is.’</p>

<p>‘Put pansies with the brambles,’ said
Charlotte; ‘that’ll be thoughts of remorse.’</p>

<p>So the housekeeper, coming down very neat
in her afternoon dress of shiny black alpaca,
was met by a bunch of pansies.</p>

<p>‘To show we think we’re remorsish about
the secret stairs,’ said Charlotte; ‘and look out,
because the brambles are the remorse and
they prick like Billy-o!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington smiled, and looked quite
nice-looking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she said. ‘I am sure you will
remember not to repeat the fault.’</p>

<p>Which wasn’t the nicest way of receiving a
remorse bouquet; but, then as Charlotte said,
perhaps she couldn’t help not knowing the
nice ways. And anyhow, she seemed pleased,
and that was the great thing, as Charlotte
pointed out.</p>

<p>Then, having done something to please
Mrs. Wilmington, they longed to do something
to please some one else, and the Uncle was
the only person they could think of doing
anything to please.</p>

<p>‘Suppose we arranged all the books in the
dining-room bookcase, in colours,—all the reds
together and all the greens, and the ugly
ones all on a shelf by themselves,’ Charlotte
suggested. And the others agreed. So that
the afternoon flew by like any old bird, as
Caroline put it; and when tea came, and the
floor and sofa and chairs were covered with
books, and one shelf was gay with red books
and half a shelf demure in green—</p>

<p>‘Your uncle isn’t coming in to-day,’ said
Mrs. Wilmington, ‘and I’m sure it’s just as
well. <i>What</i> a mess! Here, let me put them
back, and go and wash your hands.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll put them back,’ the children said,
but in vain. They had to go to wash their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
hands, and Mrs. Wilmington continued to put
the books back all the time they were having
tea. Patiently and carefully she did it, not
regarding the colours at all, and her care and
her patience seemed to say, more loudly than
any words she could have spoken, ‘Yes; there
you sit, having your nice tea, and I cannot
have <i>my</i> tea, because I have to clear up after
you. But I do not complain. No.’</p>

<p>They would have much rather she had
complained, of course. But they couldn’t
say so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>IN THESSALONIANS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> you may say it was Chance, or you
may say it was Fate; or you may say it was
Destiny, or Fortune; in fact, you may say
exactly what you choose. But the fact remains
unaltered by your remarks.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Wilmington placed a fat brown
volume of sermons on the shelf and said,
‘There, that’s the last,’ she, quite without
meaning it, said what was not true. For
when tea was over the children found that the
fat sermon-book had <i>not</i> been the last. The
last was <i>Shadoxhurst on Thessalonians</i>, a dull,
large book, and Mrs. Wilmington had not put
it back in its place because she had not seen it.
It was, in fact, lying on the floor, hidden by
the table-cloth. If Charles had not happened
to want his handkerchief, and gone down to
look for it on the floor—its usual situation
when it was needed—they would not have
seen the book either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles picked up <i>Thessalonians</i>, and the
cover ‘came off in his hand,’ as the handles of
cups do in the hands of washing-up maids.</p>

<p>What was inside the cover fell on the floor
with a thump, and Caroline picked <i>that</i> up.</p>

<p>‘<i>Shadoxhurst on Thessalonians</i>,’ Charles read
from the cover.</p>

<p>‘This isn’t,’ said Caroline, looking at what
had been inside. ‘It’s—I say! Suppose it
was the book—’</p>

<p>She looked up at the picture.</p>

<p>It was certainly <i>like</i> the painted book.</p>

<p>‘Only it hasn’t any brass clasps,’ said
Caroline; ‘but look—it <i>used</i> to have clasps.
You can see the marks where they used to go.’</p>

<p>You could.</p>

<p>‘Glory!’ cried Charlotte. ‘Fancy finding
it the very first day! Let’s take it to Uncle
Charles.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps it isn’t it,’ suggested Charlotte.
‘Then he’d be furious perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll soon see.’ Charles reached out a
hand. ‘Let’s have a squint. It ought to be all
magic and Abracadabra and crossed triangles
like in <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll have first look any way,’ said Caroline.
‘I found it.’</p>

<p>‘I found it,’ said Charles. ‘You only
picked it up.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You only dropped it. Oh, <i>bother</i>——’ she
had opened the book, and now let her hands
fall, still holding it.</p>

<p>‘Bother what?’ asked the others.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t English. It’s French or Latin or
something. Isn’t that <i>just</i> like things! Here,
you can look.’</p>

<p>Charles took the book. ‘It’s Latin,’ he said.
‘I could read it if I knew a little more Latin.
I can read some of it as it is. I know <i>quam</i>,
or <i>apud</i>, and <i>rara</i>. Let’s take it to the Uncle.’</p>

<p>‘Oh <i>no</i>,’ said Caroline. ‘Let’s find out
what it is, first.’</p>

<p>It was not easy to find out. The title-page
was missing, and <i>quam</i>, <i>apud</i>, and <i>rara</i>, though
quite all right in their way, gave but little clue
to what the book was about.</p>

<p>‘I wish we’d some one we could ask,’ said
Charles. ‘I don’t suppose the Wilmington
knows any Latin. I don’t suppose she knows
even <i>apud</i> and <i>quam</i> and <i>rara</i>. If we had the
Murdstone chap handy he could tell us, I
suppose.’</p>

<p>‘I’m glad we haven’t,’ Charlotte said. ‘I
don’t suppose he’d tell us. And he’d take it
away. I say. I suppose there’s a church somewhere
near. And a clergyman. <i>He’d</i> know.’</p>

<p>‘Of course he would,’ Caroline said with
returning brightness. ‘Let’s go and ask him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later the children, coming
down a deep banked lane, saw before them
the grey tower of the church, with elm-trees
round it, standing among old gravestones and
long grass.</p>

<p>A white faced house stood on the other side
of the churchyard.</p>

<p>‘I suppose the clergyman lives there,’ said
Caroline. ‘Please,’ she said to a pleasant-looking
hook-nosed man who was mending the
churchyard wall, and whistling ‘Blow away the
morning dew’ as he slapped on the mortar and
trimmed off the edges with a diamond-shaped
trowel, ‘please, does the clergyman live in that
house?’</p>

<p>‘He does,’ said the man with the trowel.
‘Do you want him?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, please,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Well, here he is,’ said the man with the
trowel. ‘What can I do for you?’</p>

<p>‘Do you mean to say that you’re <i>It?</i>—the
clergyman, I mean,—I beg your pardon,’ said
Caroline; and the man with the trowel said,
‘At your service.’</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon,’ said Caroline again,
very red as to her ears. ‘I thought you were
a working man.’</p>

<p>‘So I am, thank God,’ said the man with the
trowel. ‘You see we haven’t much money to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
spare. The parish is so poor. So we do any little
repairs ourselves. Did you ever set a stone?
It’s awfully jolly. The mortar goes on so
nicely, and squeezes out pleasantly. Like to
try?’ he asked Charles.</p>

<p>Of course they all liked to try. And it was
not till each had laid a stone and patted it into
place, and scraped off the mortar, and got
thoroughly dusty and dirty and comfortable,
that any one remembered why they had
come.</p>

<p>‘Oh, this?’ said the clergyman—for so I
must call him, though anything less clergyman-like
than he looked in his mortar-stained
flannels and blue blazer you can’t imagine.
‘It looks interesting. Latin,’ he said, opening
it carefully, for his hands were very dirty.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charles with modest pride. ‘I
told them it was. I saw <i>rara</i> and <i>quam</i> and
<i>apud</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Quite so,’ said the clergyman; ‘<i>rara</i>, <i>quam</i>,
and <i>apud</i>. Words of Power.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, do <i>you</i> know about Words of Power?’</p>

<p>‘Rather! Do you?’</p>

<p>‘Rather!’ they said. And if anything had
been needed to cement this new friendship well,
there it was.</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said the clergyman. ‘If you’ll
just wait while I wash my hands I’ll walk up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
with you. And I’ll look through the book and
report to you to-morrow.’</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="373" height="592" alt="Charles iwth trowel while others look on" />
<div class="caption">Of course they all liked to try.</div>
</div>

<p>‘But what’s it about?’</p>

<p>‘About?’ said he, turning the leaves
delicately with the least mortared of his fingers.
‘Oh, it’s about spells and charms and things.’</p>

<p>‘How perfectly too lovely,’ said Charlotte.
‘Oh, do read us <i>one</i>—just only <i>one</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Right O,’ was the response of this unusual
clergyman, and he read: ‘“The seed of the fern
if pulverised”—pounded—smashed, you know,—“and
laid upon the eyes at the twelfth hour”—midnight,
you know—at least I think that’s it—“last
before the feast of St. John”—that’s to-morrow
by the way—“shall give to the eyes thus
doctored”—treated—dealt with, you know,—“the
power to see that which is not to be seen.”
It means you’ll see invisible things. I say I <i>must</i>
wash. I feel the dirt soaking into my bones.
Will you wait?’</p>

<p>The children looked at each other. Then
Charlotte said:</p>

<p>‘Look here. Don’t think we don’t like you.
We do—awfully. But if you walk up with us
will you feel bound to tell uncle about the book?
Because it’s a secret. He’s looking for a book,
and we think perhaps this is it. But we don’t
want to tell him till we’re quite sure.’</p>

<p>‘I found it inside Somebody-or-other-quite-dull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
on Thessalonians, you know,’ said Charles,
‘and I saw it was Latin because of <i>quam</i>
and——’</p>

<p>‘My dear sir—and ladies,’ said the agreeable
clergyman, ‘I am the soul of honour. I would
perish at the stake before I would reveal a
centimetre of your least secret. Trust me to
the death.’</p>

<p>And off he went.</p>

<p>‘What a different clergyman,’ said Charles;
‘he is just like anybody else—only nicer.’</p>

<p>‘He said thank God,’ Caroline reminded
him; ‘he said it like being in church too, not
like cabmen and people in the street.’</p>

<p>‘He said “Thank God he was a working
man,”’ said Charlotte. ‘I wonder what he
meant.’</p>

<p>‘I shall ask him some day,’ said Caroline,
‘when we know him better.’</p>

<p>But any one who had met the party as they
went talking and laughing up the hill would
have thought they had known each other for
long enough, and could hardly know each other
any better than they did.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Charles was dreaming of mortaring the
Murdstone man securely into a first-class
railway carriage, and tapping him on the head
with a brass trowel which was also a candlestick,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
when he was awakened by a pinch given gently.
At the same moment a hand was laid on his
mouth, and a whisper said:</p>

<p>‘Hist!—not a word.’</p>

<p>‘Shut up,’ said Charles, recognising at once
the voice of his sister Charlotte. ‘I’m asleep.
Don’t be a duffer. Go to bed.’</p>

<p>‘No, but,’ said Charlotte in the dark,
‘Caroline and I have been talking about the
fern-seed. And we’re going to try it—putting
it on our eyes, I mean. To see whether we
can see invisible things.’</p>

<p>‘Silly,’ said Charles briefly.</p>

<p>‘All right. Only don’t say we didn’t ask
you to join in.’</p>

<p>‘There isn’t any fern-seed,’ objected Charles.</p>

<p>‘Yes, there is. Mrs. Wilmington’s got
some in the room they call the housekeeper’s
room. Under a bell-glass. Stupid little ferns;
but I expect the seed’s all right. Caro saw
them when she went in to ask the Wilmington
if we might get up at seven instead of half-past
because of everything being so new and lovely.
She meant because of the charm-book, of
course. And she saw the ferns then.’</p>

<p>‘Are you <i>really</i> going to?’ asked Charles,
warm in bed.</p>

<p>‘<i>Yes</i>,’ said Charlotte in a take-it-or-leave-it
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, very well,’ said Charles; ‘only don’t
forget I told you it was silly rot. And of
course nothing will happen. I was right about
the Latin, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Here’s your dressing-gown,’ said Charlotte,
who had been feeling for it in the mahogany
wardrobe. ‘You can scrabble for your shoes
with your feet; I suppose they’re beside the
bed. Hurry up.’</p>

<p>Charles got up, grumbling gently. It was
not to be expected that he would feel the same
about this wild fern-seed idea as his sisters, who
had thought and talked of nothing else for
more than three hours, and had had to pinch
each other to keep awake. Still, he got up,
and they all went down to Mrs. Wilmington’s
room, which was warm and seemed full of
antimacassars, china ornaments, and cheerfully-bound
copies of the poets—the kind that are
given for birthday presents and prizes, beautiful
outside, and inside very small print on thin
paper that lets the printing on the other side
show through. Charlotte found this out as
they waited, by the light of their one candle,
for it to be twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>Caroline was plucking fronds of fern, carefully,
so that the lack of them should not
disfigure the plants.</p>

<p>‘It’s all duffing,’ said Charles. ‘Don’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
forget I said so. And how are you going to
pound the beastly stuff? You’ll wake the
Wilmington and the Uncle and the whole lot
if you pound.’</p>

<p>‘I thought,’ said Caroline, hesitating with
the fern-fronds in her hand, and her little short
pig-tail sticking out like a saucepan handle, as
Charles put it later, ‘I thought—it sounds
rather nasty, but it isn’t really, you know, if
you remember it’s all <i>you</i>—I thought we might
<i>chew</i> them. Each do our own, you know, and
put them on our eyes like a poultice. I know
you hated it when Aunt Emmeline chewed
the lily leaves and put them on your thumb
when you burnt it,’ she told Charles, ‘but then
<i>her</i> chewing is quite different from you doing
it.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> don’t care,’ said Charles; ‘it’s only a bit
more of your nonsense. Give us the beastly
seeds.’</p>

<p>‘They won’t come off the leaves,’ said
Caroline. ‘We shall have to chew the lot.’</p>

<p>‘In for a penny, in for a sheep,’ said Charlotte
cheerfully. ‘I mean we may as well be
hanged for a pound as a lamb. I mean——’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> know what you mean,’ Caroline interrupted.
‘Here you are. It’s just on twelve.
Chew for all you’re worth, and when the
Wilmington’s clock begins to strike put it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
your eyes. And when it’s struck six of them
take it off. Yes. I’ve thought about it all.
I’m sure that’s right. Now, then, chew.’</p>

<p>‘I hope it’s not poison,’ said Charles; ‘you’ll
remember I told you——’</p>

<p>‘Of course it isn’t,’ said Caroline. ‘I’ve
often licked ferns, and I’m not dead. I say—I
daresay nothing will happen—but think
how silly we should feel if we hadn’t tried it.
And this is the only night. He said so.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, all right,’ said Charles. ‘At any rate,
if we do it you can’t be always saying we ought
to have.’</p>

<p>‘Chew,’ said Charlotte; and the clock began
to strike.</p>

<p>‘One, two, three, four, five, six,’ said Mrs.
Wilmington’s highly ornamented pink china
clock; and each child thrust a little bunch of
fern fronds into its mouth.</p>

<p>‘Seven,’ said the clock.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>And each child.... But you picture the
scene.</p>

<p>‘Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, purr,’
said the clock, and said no more.</p>

<p>‘I don’t like to take it off,’ said Charlotte,
her hands to her eyes. ‘Suppose we <i>did</i> see
something.’</p>

<p>‘We shan’t,’ said Charles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You must,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Oh, well,’ said Charlotte, and took away the
little poultice of chewed fern from each eye.</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘I knew there wouldn’t be,’ said Charles.
‘Perhaps another time you’ll know I’m right.’</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Caroline. ‘We did it.
So we can’t keep bothering about what might
have happened if we had. Let’s go to bed.
It was decent of you to try, Charles, when you
didn’t want to so much—Oh!’</p>

<p>‘What?’ said the others.</p>

<p>‘Poisoned,’ said Charles gloomily. ‘I knew
it wasn’t safe. I expect you chewed harder than
we did, and—Oh!’</p>

<p>Charlotte had already said her ‘Oh.’ And
now all three children were staring straight
before them at the window. And there, where
a moment ago was just black bare outside
night, was a face—a white face with wide dark
eyes.</p>

<p>‘It’s true,’ gasped Caroline, ‘it is true—the
fern-seed does——’</p>

<p>‘It’s not true,’ said Charles stoutly, his eyes
on the face.</p>

<p>‘Oh, but it is,’ said Charlotte. ‘Oh, what’s
going to happen now?’</p>

<p>And each child felt that the fern-seed had
done what no one had, in the deep heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
believed that it would do, and that their eyes
now gazed—seeing—upon the unseen.</p>

<p>‘I wish we hadn’t,’ said Charles. ‘I told
you not to.’</p>

<p>The lips of the face outside moved, as though
it were speaking.</p>

<p>‘No,’ cried Charlotte. ‘I don’t <i>want</i> it to
be true.’</p>

<p>A hand was raised—a hand outside the
window. Would it knock at the window?
The fern-seed only made you see the unseen,
not hear the unheard. If the hand knocked
at the window—and plainly it was going to
knock,—if the hand knocked, would they hear
it?</p>

<p>The hand knocked.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span>, the fern-seed was only warranted to
show the invisible, not to make the unhearable
heard. If there should be no sound when
that raised hand tapped at the window, then
the children would know that the fern-seed
was doing what it was warranted to do by the
Latin book. If, on the other hand, the hand
tapped and made, in tapping, the usual noise
produced by a common tapper, then one of
two things might be true. Either the fern-seed
was stronger than the Latin book bargained
for, and was able to make people hear
the unhearable even if they did not cover their
ears with the charm that had covered their
eyes, or else the fern-seed spell was all
nonsense and the face outside the window
was a real person’s face and the hand was a
real person’s hand, and the tap that was coming
on the window was a really-tap that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sound hard and rattly on the glass of the
window, as taps sound when fingers of bone
and flesh make them.</p>

<p>All the children felt quite sure that they
were not at all sure whether they wanted the
face to be the face of a real person, or whether
they wished it to be the Invisible made visible
by fern-seed. But when the hand tapped at
the window and a sound came to the children
within—a sound quite distinct, and just the
noise you or I might make if we tapped at a
window and didn’t want every one in the house
to hear us—the children, though startled, no
longer felt any doubt as to what they wished
that face to be.</p>

<p>‘It’s only a real person,’ whispered Charles,
and sighed deeply.</p>

<p>‘It’s only a boy,’ said Caroline. ‘What
does he want?’</p>

<p>‘It’s that Rupert chap we saw in the train,’
said Charlotte.</p>

<p>Every one breathed much more freely, and
they all smiled and nodded towards the
window; and the face nodded back, but it did
not smile.</p>

<p>‘He must have run away,’ said Charles,
‘like I told him to.’</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t you; it was me,’ said Charlotte
promptly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I like this much better than its being
invisible people,’ said Charles, changing the
subject a little. ‘This is something <i>like</i> an
adventure.’</p>

<p>‘We shouldn’t have had it without coming
down for the fern-seed,’ Caroline reminded
him. And again they all nodded and smiled.
The face outside moved its lips. It was saying
something, but they could not hear what it said.</p>

<p>‘It <i>is</i> that Rupert boy,’ Caroline insisted;
‘and he’s run away to <i>us</i>. What larks!’</p>

<p>And again she nodded, and so did Charles.
But Charlotte said, ‘Don’t let’s go on nodding
like Chinese pagodas. Of course, it wants
to come in.’ And at once the others saw
that this was the case.</p>

<p>‘He can’t get in here,’ Charlotte said; and,
indeed, to have moved that table on which the
fern-filled bell-glass stood surrounded by
unhappy-looking little ferns in little dry pots,
with bits of old tumbler arched protectively
over them, would have been dangerous, and
probably noisy. And, unless they removed
the ferny difficulties, it was quite plain that
the window could not be opened.</p>

<p>‘The morning-room is next door—Mrs.
Wilmington called it that,’ said Caroline. ‘It’s
a French window. She said so. It opens all
right. I know how the fastenings go.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why “French”?’ asked Charlotte, eager
for information even at that exciting moment,
while Caroline was trying to explain to the
face by signs that if it would just go along till
it came to a French window it would find
some one ready to let it in. ‘Why “French”?’</p>

<p>‘Because it’s like a door,’ said Charles,
joining in the sign-message. ‘Everything in
France is the opposite of here. They say “we”
for “yes,” and “two” is “you,” and “four” is
an “oven.” Silly, I call it.’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ whispered Caroline. ‘Tread softly,
and don’t tumble over the wolf-skins.’</p>

<p>Candle-bearing, the little procession passed
along to the morning-room. The face had
understood the signs. At any rate, there it
was, framed in glass panes; and when the
French window, which was, indeed, just like a
door, was opened, there was the face, as well
as the hands, arms, legs, body, and feet, of
Rupert, the platform boy, or somebody exactly
like him.</p>

<p>‘Come in,’ said Caroline, holding the door
open. And Charlotte added, ‘Fear nothing!
We will baffle your pursuers. We are yours
to the death.’</p>

<p>He came in, a drooping dusty figure, and
the French window, which had permitted itself
to be opened with the most gentle and noisele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>ss
submission, now, in closing, uttered what was
little less than a tactless squawk.</p>

<p>‘Fly!’ whispered Caroline, swiftly turning
the handle that fastened it. ‘But your boots
will betray us.’</p>

<p>Flight was the only thing, you see, and they
had to risk the boots. Yet Rupert in his flight
was noiseless as the others, who were all bath-slippered,
and therefore shod with—if you were
only reasonably careful and looked where you
were going—the shoes of silence.</p>

<p>When the whole party was safe in Charles’s
room, with the door shut, they blew out the
candles and stood holding each other and
their breaths as they listened in the dark
for what they fully expected to hear—the
opening click of Mrs. Wilmington’s lock, the
opening creak of Mrs. Wilmington’s door, the
approaching rustle of Mrs. Wilmington’s gown,
the mincing amazement of Mrs. Wilmington’s
voice.</p>

<p>But all was still—still as the inside of a
palm-house, which, as no doubt you know, is
very much quieter than most of the few quiet
places in this noisy world.</p>

<p>The four fugitives let their breaths go
cautiously, and again held them. And still
the silence wrapped them round, thick and
unbroken as the darkness in which they stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s all right,’ whispered Caroline at last.
‘Light up.’</p>

<p>Fortunately, each silver candlestick had its
box of safety-matches in a silver holder fastened
to its handle by a silver chain. This does
happen in really well-managed houses. The
candles were lighted.</p>

<p>‘We are saved,’ said Charlotte dramatically.</p>

<p>‘You came up like a mouse,’ said Caroline
to Rupert,—‘a quiet mouse.’</p>

<p>It was then seen that Rupert’s boots were
not on his feet, but in his hand, very muddy,
and tied together by frayed boot-laces.</p>

<p>‘I took them off,’ he explained, ‘when I
got into your park. My feet hurt so, and the
grass was so soft and jolly. Oh, I am so
tired—and hungry!’ His voice broke a little,
and if he had not been a boy I think he would
have cried.</p>

<p>‘Get on to the bed,’ said Charlotte, with
eager friendliness, ‘and lie down. You be a
wounded warrior and we’ll be an Arab oasis
that you’ve come to. That’s the tent of the
sheikh,’ she added, as Charles gave the weary
Rupert a ‘leg up’ and landed him among
the billows of the vast feather-bed. ‘Repose
there, weary but honoured stranger. Though
but humble Arabs, we are hospitable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
strangers. We will go and slay a desert deer
for you.’</p>

<p>‘There are lots of biscuits in the sideboard
in the dining-room,’ said Caroline. ‘I’ll stay
with the wounded—or else you can stay and
I’ll go with whichever doesn’t.’</p>

<p>Though it was the middle of the night no
one even thought of being sleepy. Perhaps
it was the excitement of this most real adventure,
or perhaps the seeds of the fern have an
awakening effect. At any rate, the three C.’s
were as ready to begin a new game as though
it had been ten o’clock in the morning of the
first day of the holidays, instead of half-past
twelve of a night that wasn’t any night in
particular except the Eve of St. John.</p>

<p>Charlotte and Charles set off, important and
tip-toeing, on a biscuit-hunt, and Caroline, like
a good little nurse, fetched a basin and sponge
and washed the face of the stranger, taking no
notice of his objections that he was not a baby,
and earnestly hoping that in her long dressing-gown
she looked at least a little like an Arab
maiden ministering to a Feringhee warrior.</p>

<p>‘Now I’m going to wash your weary feet,
if you will stick them out over the side of the
bed,’ she said. ‘They always do in Saracen
countries; and if you think it’s like a baby I’ll
call it dressing your wounds.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>She brought a chair and a basin of water
very carefully, and a big sponge, and then she
peeled off Rupert’s stockings and bathed his
tired, swollen feet with great care and gentleness.
And if a little of the water did go on
the bed—well, you can’t think of everything all
in a minute, and she did put a towel under his
legs afterwards.</p>

<p>‘That’s jolly,’ said the wounded knight,
more graciously.</p>

<p>‘You are terribly wounded,’ said Caroline
comfortingly. ‘You must have been fighting
dragons or walking over red-hot ploughshares,
or perhaps it was a pilgrimage with peas in
your shoes. We play pilgrims sometimes,
with cockles in our hats and pilgrims’ staffs—only
we always pretend the peas. I think
it’s quite fair to pretend the shoes, don’t
you?’</p>

<p>When the others came back from their hunting,
with a good ‘bag’ (it was a tin, really)
of biscuits, the Saracen maiden greeted them
with—</p>

<p>‘Hist! The stranger sleeps. Let’s pretend
he’s fainted, and we’ll rouse him with a
skin of wine. Get some water in the tooth-mug.
And where are the biscuits?’</p>

<p>‘We might as well have turbans,’ said
Charlotte, hastily twining a bath-towel round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her head. ‘All really Arab maidens are
turbaned Turks.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s make it more tent-like before we
wake him,’ Charles suggested, drawing the
curtains round two sides of the four-poster;
‘and we might put the candles out of sight
and pretend they’re Arabian knights’ lanterns.’</p>

<p>‘Or put them in a line on the chest, and let
them be the sun rising over the sands of the
desert,’ said Charlotte, putting the three candlesticks
in a row.</p>

<p>When all was arranged, the three towel-turbaned
children climbed into the tent and
looked at the wounded knight, who lay asleep,
looking very tired indeed, his feet still wrapped
in the towel and his head half fallen off the
pillow.</p>

<p>‘Let him sleep a little longer,’ said Caroline,
‘ere we rouse him to eat of the flesh of
the deer which my brothers have brought to
the wigwam for the benefit of the poor pale-face.’</p>

<p>‘We’re not Indians, silly,’ said Charlotte.
‘We’re Arabs, and I could do with a bit of the
flesh of the deer myself, if you come to that.’</p>

<p>‘So could I,’ said Charles, his turban over
one eye. ‘It’s jolly not being asleep. They
say you get sleepy and cross if they let you sit
up—but look at us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes, look at us,’ the others agreed, and
ate the best mixed biscuits in a contented
silence, broken only by the sound of crunching.</p>

<p>The familiar sensation of biscuit in the
mouth seemed somehow to calm the excitement
of the three C.’s.</p>

<p>The adventures of the night, which had
seemed, as they happened, not so very wonderful,
now began to appear more surprising, and
at the same time more real. And the silence
which biscuit-eating demands (unless you are
prepared to behave really badly and talk with
your mouth full and have the crumbs all over
the place) was favourable to reflection—a friend
to thought.</p>

<p>‘Do you know,’ said Caroline at last—‘pass
the mug, please—do you know, I don’t
at all know what we’re going to do with
him.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> was just thinking that,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘So was I,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘But I’ve been thinking——’</p>

<p>‘So have I,’ said the other two together.</p>

<p>‘What?’ asked Caroline, stopping short.</p>

<p>‘What you have,’ said Charlotte, and
Charles repeated her words.</p>

<p>‘Then I needn’t tell you what I thought,’
said Caroline briefly.</p>

<p>I think they were all getting, perhaps, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
little sleepy—or the effect of the fern-seed was
wearing off.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t be crabby,’ Charlotte said. ‘We
only meant we didn’t see what on earth we
could do with him. I suppose he must sleep
with Charles. There’s lots of room.’ She
leaned back on a pillowy bunch of featherbed
and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>‘No, you don’t,’ said Caroline firmly, pulling
her sister up again into a sitting position by a
limp arm. ‘I could go to sleep myself if it
comes to that. Take your turban off. It’ll
cool your sleepiness.’</p>

<p>‘I said’—Charlotte spoke very slowly and
distinctly, as people do when they are so sleepy
they aren’t quite sure whether they can speak
at all—‘I said, “Let him sleep with Charles.”’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes!’ said Caroline. ‘And be found
in the morning when they call us, and taken
alive and delivered back to the Murdstone
man. No, we must hide him, and wake him
before they call us. I can always wake up if
I bang my head the right number of times on
the pillow before I go to sleep.’</p>

<p>Charlotte was nodding happily.</p>

<p>‘Get up!’ said Caroline, exasperated. ‘Get
up! Get down! Get off the bed and stand
on your feet. Now, then, Charles!’</p>

<p>But Charles was deeply slumbering, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
his mouth very much more open than it ought
to have been.</p>

<p>‘That’s it!’ said Caroline, as Charlotte responded
to her pull. ‘That’s it. It’s just you
and me! Women always have to do the work
of the world! Aunt Emmeline said so once.
She said it’s not “Men must work and women
must weep”; it’s “Men must talk and women
must work.” Come on and give me a hand.’</p>

<p>‘All right. I’m awake now,’ said Charlotte
cheerfully. ‘I’ve been biting my tongue all
that awful time you’ve been talking. What’s
the idea?’</p>

<p>‘We’ll make him an upper berth, like in
ships,’ Caroline explained, ‘and then we’ll wake
him up and water him and biscuit him and
explain things, and get Charles into bed and
all traces concealed. It’ll be just you and me
that did it. That’s glory, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>do</i> stop talking,’ said Charlotte. ‘I’ll
do anything you like, only stop talking.’</p>

<p>There was a great mahogany wardrobe in
the room, with a mahogany hanging-cupboard
at each side, and between the mahogany cupboards
a space with mahogany drawers below
and mahogany shelves above. And the shelves
were like shallow drawers or deep trays, and
you could pull them in and out. There was
nothing on the shelves but clean white paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and on each shelf a little bag made of white
muslin and filled with dried lavender, which
smelt very sweet through the fine mesh of the
muslin.</p>

<p>The girls took out two of the trays and hid
them under the bed. This left as much space
above the lowest tray and the highest as they
leave you on a steamer between the upper and
lower berths. The girls made up a shake-down
bed with blankets and pillows, and when
all was ready they woke the boys gently and
firmly by a damp sponge on the forehead and
a hand over the mouth in case the sleeper
should wake up yelling.</p>

<p>But both boys woke quietly. Charles had
just enough wakefulness to submit to being got
out of his overcoat and slippers and bundled
into bed, but Rupert was thoroughly awake—ate
biscuit, drank water, and understood exactly
where and how he was to spend what was left
of the night, as well as why he was to spend it
there and thus.</p>

<p>He got into the wardrobe by means of a
chair. The girls took away the chair and
almost shut the doors of the wardrobe.</p>

<p>‘We’ll have a grand council to-morrow,’
said Charlotte. ‘Don’t be anxious. Just remember
we’re yours to the death, like I told
you on the platform.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It was <i>me</i> said that,’ said Charles, almost
in his sleep.</p>

<p>‘And don’t move out of here, whatever you
do,’ said Caroline. ‘I shall come quite early,
and we’ll hide you somewhere. I expect I
shall think of something in my sleep. I often
do. Good night.’</p>

<p>‘Good night,’ said Rupert, in the wardrobe.
‘I say! You are bricks—and you won’t let
them catch me?’</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ said the three C.’s confidently.
(Charles said it quite in his sleep.)</p>

<p>Five minutes later the others were sleeping
as soundly as Charles, and out Tonbridge way
the Murdstone man and his groom and his
gardener and the local Police were still looking
for Rupert with anxious feelings, with lanterns
that flickered yellow in the pale grey of dawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>HUNTED</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">I don’t</span> know exactly how it happened. Perhaps
Caroline was too sleepy to bump her
head seven times on the pillow before she went
to sleep. Or perhaps that excellent spell cannot
always be relied upon to work. At any
rate, none of the children woke till Jane came
to draw up the blinds and let the half-past
seven sunshine into their rooms.</p>

<p>Then Caroline woke quite thoroughly,
looked at her little watch, and leaped out of bed.</p>

<p>‘What’s the hurry, Miss?’ asked Jane, as
Caroline stood, a little unsteadily, in the middle
of the room, rubbing her eyes and yawning.
‘It hasn’t but just gone the half-hour.’</p>

<p>‘I was dreaming,’ said Caroline; and when
Jane was gone she shook Charlotte and said,
‘I say! <i>Did</i> anything happen last night?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Charlotte, behaving like a dormouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Caroline caught up her dressing-gown and
crept along to Charles’s room. He was sitting
up in bed, looking wildly at the wardrobe.
Its doors were open, and there was nothing
on the shelves (which were all in their proper
places) except clean paper and little bags of
lavender that smelt sweet through their white
muslin veils.</p>

<p>‘Whatever’s happened?’ asked Caroline,
fearing the worst.</p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing,’ said Charles, rather crossly.
‘Only I had a silly dream, and when I woke
up I thought it was true, and of course it
wasn’t.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> thought it was a dream, too, when I first
woke. And Charlotte says nothing happened
last night. What did you dream?’</p>

<p>He told her a little.</p>

<p>‘But I dreamed all that, too,’ said Caroline
anxiously. ‘About the fern-seed and Rupert,
and our playing Arab Saracens and hunting
the biscuits. We <i>couldn’t</i> both dream the
same thing. Where did you put the biscuits
in your dream—what was left of them?’</p>

<p>‘You put them on the dressing-table.’</p>

<p>‘Well, they aren’t there now,’ said she.</p>

<p>‘Then it <i>was</i> a dream,’ said he; ‘and we
both dreamed it.’</p>

<p>The two looked at each other blankly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I dreamed I dressed his wounds—sponged
his feet, I mean,’ she added, after a pause full
of doubt. ‘The mud was thick—if it wasn’t
a dream it’ll be in the basin.’</p>

<p>But Jane knew her duty too well for there
to be anything in the basin except a bright
brass can of hot water with a clean towel laid
neatly across it.</p>

<p>‘Well, the fern-seed did something, anyhow,
if it only made us both dream like that,’ said
Caroline. But Charles wanted to know how she
knew they hadn’t dreamed the fern-seed as well.</p>

<p>‘Oh, you get dressed,’ said his sister
shortly, and went to her own dressing.</p>

<p>Charlotte, when really roused, owned that
she remembered Rupert’s coming. But, if he
had come, he had gone and left no trace.
And it is rare for boys to do that.</p>

<p>The children agreed that it must have been
a dream, after the eating of the fern-seed, for
all of them, for some reason that I can’t understand,
agreed that the fern-seed eating, at any
rate, was real.</p>

<p>Breakfast seemed less interesting than
usual, and when, after the meal, Mrs. Wilmington
minced a request to them to go out
for the morning, ‘the same as you were requisted
to do yisterday,’ they went with slow
footsteps and boots strangely weighty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Let’s get out of sight of the house,’ said
Charlotte heavily.</p>

<p>They went away beyond the shrubbery, to
the wood where there were oak-trees and
hazels and dog-wood and silver birches and
here and there a black yew, with open bracken-feathered
glades between. Here they found
a little glade between a honeysuckle and a
sweet chestnut and a hazel thicket, flattened
the bracken, and sat down amid the sweet
scent of it.</p>

<p>‘To hold a council about the wonderful
dream we’ve all of us had,’ said Caroline
slowly.</p>

<p>But the council, if it could be called one,
was brief and languid.</p>

<p>‘I’d rather think first,’ said Caroline. And
the others said so would they.</p>

<p>‘I could think better with my head on your
lap, Caro,’ Charles said.</p>

<p>And Charlotte murmured, ‘Bunch the fern
up closer under my back, Caro.’</p>

<p>And when the sun came over the top of
the sweet chestnut it fell upon a warm and
comfortable heap of children asleep.</p>

<p>You really can’t stay up all night, or even
dream that you stay up, and then hold important
councils next day just as though
nothing had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>When the children awoke, because the sun
had crept up over the sweet chestnut and was
shining straight into their eyes, everything
looked different and much more interesting.</p>

<p>‘I tell you what,’ said Charlotte. ‘Let’s
do fern-seed again.’</p>

<p>‘It’s only on the eve of——’ Charles began,
but Charlotte interrupted.</p>

<p>‘The seed goes on when once you’ve planted
it—chewed it, I mean. I’m certain it does.
If we don’t <i>see</i> anything, we may <i>dream</i> something
more.’</p>

<p>‘There wouldn’t be time for a really thick
dream before dinner,’ Charles objected.</p>

<p>‘Never mind! Let’s try. If we are late
for dinner we’d tell the truth and say that we
fell asleep in the woods. There’s such heaps
of fern here it would be simply silly not to
try.’</p>

<p>There was something in this. Fern-seed
was chewed once more. Bracken, I have
heard really well-educated people say, is not
a fern at all, but it seemed a fern to them.
And it certainly did its best to act up to what
was expected of it. For when the three removed
the little green damp pads from their
eyes and blinked at the green leaves, there in
the thick of them was Rupert, looking at them
between the hazel thicket and the honeysuckle—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
real live Rupert, and no dream-nonsense
about him.</p>

<p>‘<i>Was</i> it a dream last night?’ they all asked
him, in an eager chorus. ‘When you came to
the window?’</p>

<p>‘Of course it wasn’t,’ he said flatly. ‘Only
I was so afraid of being nabbed. So I got
out early and put the shelves back and the
pillows on the bed, and I took the biscuits;
I thought you wouldn’t mind——’</p>

<p>‘Not a bit. Rather not’—chorus of polite
hospitality.</p>

<p>‘And I got out of your dressing-room
window and down the ivy; it was quite easy.
And I cut across the grass and in under those
fancy sort of fir-trees, the ones that drag their
branches—you know—in the avenue. And I
saw you come out, but the place was all thick
with gardeners and people. So I waited till
their dinner-bell rang, and then I crept out
here, and I was just going to say “Hi!” when
you stuck that green stuff on your eyes. It
looks nasty. What did you do it for?’</p>

<p>They told him.</p>

<p>‘That’s rummy,’ he said, sitting among
them quite at his ease, with one hand in his
pocket. ‘Because I knew fern-seed <i>made</i> you
invisible—it says so in Shakespeare, you know,—and
I ate a bit coming along, just on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
chance it might be some good—so that no
one should see me, you know—and nobody
<i>did</i> till you did. So,’ he went on more slowly,
‘perhaps I was <i>really</i> invisible until you put
the fern-seed on your eyes.’</p>

<p>‘What a perfectly splendid idea!’ cried
Charlotte. ‘Because that makes it all true.
We were most awfully sick when we thought
it had only just made us dream. I say! Do,
now, do tell us how you ran away and why—and
what you’re going to do, and everything.’</p>

<p>‘I thought,’ Rupert answered carelessly,
‘of running away to sea. But it’s a long way
to the coast. I would much rather stop here
with you. Couldn’t you hide me in a log-hut
or something, like a runaway slave? Just till
they stopped looking for me. And I could
write to my father in India and ask him to
let me stay here instead of with old Mug’s
brother. Couldn’t you hide me till the answer
came?’</p>

<p>‘We could try,’ said Charles, a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>But Charlotte said, ‘Of course we can—we
will! Only, why are you so different?
You seem miles older than you were when we
saw you on the platform.’</p>

<p>‘<i>You’d</i> look miles older if you’d locked your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
master in his study and then done a bunk—and
been running and hiding for half a day
and a night,’ said Rupert, a little crossly.</p>

<p>‘But what did he <i>do</i> to you?’ they asked.</p>

<p>‘Well, you saw what he was like in the
train.’</p>

<p>‘But you seemed so frightened of him. I
wonder you dared to run away.’</p>

<p>‘That wasn’t funk—in the train. That
was just suppressed fury,’ Rupert explained
tranquilly. ‘I was wondering where I should
run to if I had to run. And then I did have
to run—like Billy-o! And when I saw the
name on a sign-post I remembered what you’d
said about “true to the death”—and I kept
behind the hedges, because I wasn’t sure about
the fern-seed being any good, and I got up a
tree and I saw you go by, and when you came
back with the parson I just followed on quietly
till I got to outside your house. I hoped
you’d come out, but you didn’t. And I hid
under one of those fancy firs, and then, I
suppose, I went to sleep, and when I woke up
there was a light in a window, and I went
towards it, stupid, like a bird. You know
how sparrows come out of the ivy if you show
a light?’</p>

<p>They didn’t.</p>

<p>‘Well, they do. And then I saw you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
monkeying about. I <i>was</i> glad, I tell you.
And I tapped on the window, and—you know
the rest,’ he ended, like a hero in a book.</p>

<p>‘But what did the Murdstone man <i>do</i> to
you?’ Charlotte insisted on knowing.</p>

<p>‘He was playing up for a row from the very
first,’ said Rupert; ‘and when we got to his
beastly house that night’—Rupert lowered
his voice and spoke in a tone of deep disgust
and bitterness—‘he gave me bread and milk
to eat. Bread and milk—with a teaspoon!
And when I said I’d rather not, he said I must
learn to eat what was set before me. And
he talked about discipline and showed me
a cane. He said he was glad there were no
other little boys there—little boys!—because
he could devote himself entirely to breaking
me in.’</p>

<p>‘Beast!’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘He thought I was a muff of a white
rabbit,’ said Rupert; ‘but he knows the
difference now.’</p>

<p>I hope you will not think base scorn of
Charles and Caroline when I own that they
were both feeling a little uncomfortable in
the presence of this young desperado. Fern-seed
is all very well, and so is the idea of
running away from school, but that any master
should really be so piglike as to make running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
away necessary—this came too near to the
really terrible for them to feel quite easy
about it.</p>

<p>‘He must be like the Spanish Inquisition,’
said Charlotte indignantly. ‘Why isn’t he
put in prison now there are proper laws?’</p>

<p>But Charles and Caroline still felt that it
was less likely that the Murdstone man should
be so hateful than that Rupert should be
drawing long-bows to excuse his running
away. If he had been timid and miserable
they would have believed him more. As it
was, he was easy when he wasn’t defiant.</p>

<p>You know that feeling—when you are not
quite sure of some one you want to be kind to—when
you can’t be quite certain that if you
believe what they say you won’t be being
unjust to somebody else. It is a hateful feeling.
There is nothing more miserable than
not being able to trust some one you want to
trust. You know, perhaps, what that sensation
is? Rupert, at any rate, must have
known it, and must have known that the others
were feeling it, for he suddenly pulled his
hand out from his pocket.</p>

<p>‘Look here, then,’ he said. ‘But—no, I
don’t blame you. I know it’s not the sort of
thing you’d expect to be true. Yes. He did
it. The first night. About the bread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a><br /><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a><br /><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
milk. Came and did it after I was in bed.
With a ruler.’</p>

<div class="caption">‘<i>I</i> believed you—without that,’ said Charlotte.</div>
</div>

<p>‘It’ was a blue bruise and a slight red
graze across the back of the hand that, till
now, had been hidden.</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> believed you—without that,’ said
Charlotte, with hot cheeks. ‘<i>I</i> know there are
people like that. Like <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>.’</p>

<p>‘We do believe you,’ said Caroline
earnestly. ‘Who said we didn’t?’</p>

<p>And Charles said, ‘Of course we do—what
nonsense! We’ll bring you a paper and
pencil and an envelope, and you can write to
your father. And we <i>will</i> conceal you.’</p>

<p>‘Right O!’ said Rupert. ‘Hush!’</p>

<p>They hushed, and, Rupert pointing through
the blue gap between the oak and the honeysuckle,
their eyes followed the pointing of his
finger. A figure was coming up the drive—a
figure in blue.</p>

<p>‘Go and see what it is,’ whispered Rupert,
‘but don’t let on.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll go,’ said Charlotte, jumping up.</p>

<p>‘But what’ll you say if they ask you what
you’ve come in for?’ Charles asked.</p>

<p>‘I shall say I’ve come in to fetch you a
pocket-handkerchief,’ said Charlotte witheringly,
‘because you wanted one so badly.
You always do.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>She went.</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said Caroline, once more
thrilling to the part of the protecting Saracen
maiden. ‘Suppose they’re after you? Let’s
cover you up with leaves and bracken, so that
your tweediness won’t show through the trees
if they look—and bracken over your head.
Creep through the bracken; don’t crush it
more than you can help.’</p>

<p>Rupert was entirely hidden when Charlotte
returned, very much out of breath, from an
unexpected part of the wood.</p>

<p>‘I came round,’ she whispered, ‘to put them
off the scent.’</p>

<p>‘Who?’ asked Rupert, under the leaves.</p>

<p>‘The Police,’ said Charlotte, with calm
frankness and a full sense of the tremendous
news she was bringing. ‘They’re inquiring
after <i>you</i>. They’ve traced you to Hadlow.’</p>

<p>‘What did they say at the house?’</p>

<p>‘They said they hadn’t seen you, but the
Police might search the grounds.’</p>

<p>‘What did you say?’</p>

<p>‘I wasn’t asked,’ said Charlotte demurely.
‘But I’ll tell you what I did say. You lie
mouse-still, Rupert; it’s all right. I’m glad
you’re buried, though.’</p>

<p>‘What <i>did</i> you say?’</p>

<p>‘I said,’ Charlotte answered, glowing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the pride of a successful strategist—‘I said
we’d help them to search! Come on, the three
C.’s. Round the back way! <i>We’ll</i> help them
to search for their runaway boy—so we will!
And when they’ve gone we’ll bring you something
to eat—something really nice—not just
biscuits. Don’t you worry. The three C.’s
<i>are</i> yours to the death.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>BEING DETECTIVES</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">If</span> you are Jack Delamere, the Boy Detective
who can find out all secrets by himself, pretending
to be a French count, a young lady
from the provinces, or a Lincolnshire labourer
with a cold in his head, and in those disguises
pass unrecognised by his nearest relations and
by those coiners and smugglers to whom in
his ordinary clothes he is only too familiar,—if
you can so alter your voice that your old
school-fellows believe you to be, when dressed
for the part, an Italian organ-grinder or a
performing bear——</p>

<p>I am sorry, this sentence is too much for
me. I give it up. What I was going to say
was that persons accustomed to the detective
trade, or, on the other hand, persons who are
used to keeping out of the way of detectives,
no doubt find it easy to play a part and to
look innocent when they are guilty, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
ignorant when of course all is known to them.
But when you are not accustomed to playing
a part in a really serious adventure—not just
a pretending one—you will find your work cut
out for you. This was what Charles and
Caroline felt.</p>

<p>It was all very well for Charlotte to have
arranged that they should help the Police to
look for Rupert, and the other two said cordially
that it was very clever of her to have thought
of it, and they all started together for the side
door where the policeman was still talking to
Mrs. Wilmington. But their feet seemed
somehow not to want to go that way; they
went more and more slowly, and when they
were half-way to the house, Caroline said:</p>

<p>‘I don’t think I will. I don’t know how.
I should do something silly and give the show
away. I shall say I’m too tired.’</p>

<p>‘You <i>are</i> too bad,’ said Charlotte, exasperated.
‘I go and lay all the plans and then
you funk.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t,’ said Caroline. And so anxious
was she not to have to play the part of pretending
to look for Rupert when all the time
she knew where he was, that she added
humbly, ‘Don’t be snarky. I’m only saying
I’m not clever enough. I’m not so clever as
you, that’s all.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Charlotte only
answered ‘Rats!’ and added, ‘I suppose
Charles is going to cry off next?’ She did
not think he was: she just said it. And
Charles most unexpectedly answered:</p>

<p>‘I think I’d rather not, if you don’t mind.’</p>

<p>Charlotte stamped her foot. ‘Oh, all
right!’ she said; ‘but for goodness’ sake come
on. They’ll think there’s something up.’
And they walked on.</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said Caroline suddenly, ‘I <i>will</i>
pretend to help. It was only that I was so
awfully afraid they’d find him. Only if I
disappear, you’ll understand it’s just because I
felt sillier than I could bear. You help too,
Charles. I’m sure you can—only don’t pretend
too much. I shouldn’t talk much except
asking questions, if I were you.’</p>

<p>‘Right O!’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>And Charles said, ‘Oh, well, only if I give
it away without meaning to, don’t blame me.’</p>

<p>And by this time they were quite near the
house, by whose side door of many-coloured
glass the group of talking grown-ups awaited
them. Mrs. Wilmington was there with her
handkerchief over her head. And William
and the gardener’s boy and the gardener, and
a tall stout young man with fat red hands who
was the Police.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I can’t and won’t,’ Mrs. Wilmington was
saying. ‘The Master’s orders is—are—that
he’s not to be disturbed in the mornings on
any pretence—not if the house was on fire.
I couldn’t face him with this vulgar tale of
runaway boys. <i>I</i> give you leave to search for
him,’ she said in proud refined accents. ‘I’m
quate competent to take <i>that</i> upon me; quate.’</p>

<p>The Police turned from her to the children,
who said ‘Good morning!’—all but Charlotte,
who had said it before.</p>

<p>‘Good morning to <i>you</i>,’ said the Police,
‘and so you young ladies and gents is going
to join the search-party?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, please,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘What’ll you do with him if you catch him?’
Caroline asked abruptly.</p>

<p>‘Send him to gaol, in course,’ said the
Police, winking at William. ‘An’ you’re all
going to help the law in the execution of its
duty. And very useful I daresay you’ll be,’
he added affably, ‘knowing the place and what
not. Now see here,’ he went on, condescending
to them in a way which, it was remarked
later, was like his cheek; ‘let’s have a game
of play, make-believe, you know. Let’s
pretend this runaway lad is a friend of yours’
(a cold shiver ran down three youthful backs;
for a moment it seemed that all was discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
but the Police went on, still playfully)—‘a
friend of yours, and you and him has settled to
play a little game of hide-and-seek. And he’s
He. Now where,’ he ended, more affably
almost than they could bear,—‘where would
you look first?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Charles miserably.</p>

<p>‘Oh! just anywhere,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>But Caroline said slowly, ‘I should look
in the wood over there,’ and pointed straight
to the spot where Rupert lay buried in fern
and leaves.</p>

<p>‘Right you are,’ said the Police, delighted
to have got a suggestion. ‘Then here goes.’</p>

<p>Charlotte dared not look at her sister lest
her face should show her detestation of this
traitorous act. Charles put his hands in his
pockets to express indifference, and decided
not to whistle for fear of overdoing his part.
He told himself that he never would have
believed it of Caro—never.</p>

<p>And now Caroline was speaking again,
looking confidingly up into the large patronising
face of the Police.</p>

<p>‘That’s where I should look,’ she was
saying, ‘if we were playing hide-and-seek.
But as it is—— You see we’ve been there
all the morning, and he couldn’t have come
into the wood without our hearing him, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
know. Have you tried the other wood,
beyond the garden? And the thatched
summer-house? And the lodge that isn’t
used? Over by the other gates, you know.’</p>

<p>‘The old lodge,’ the Police echoed. ‘A
very likely spot, I shouldn’t wonder. You
lead the way, young gentleman,’ he said to
Charles.</p>

<p>‘Good old Caro—oh, <i>good</i> old Caro!’
Charlotte was saying to herself as the party
started.</p>

<p>‘I’ll dispose my search-party proper later
on,’ said the Police importantly, and turned to
say, ‘Ain’t you coming, Miss?’ to Caroline,
who was stooping down, doing something to
her foot.</p>

<p>‘I can’t,’ she said; ‘I’ve got a stone in my
shoe. And it hurts,’ she added, standing up
firmly on it.</p>

<p>Caroline went indoors, and the search-party
threaded the woods and converged at last on
the empty lodge. Its lattice-paned windows
were dusty, its door hung on a broken hinge,
and little black balls of hard moss were dotted
between the flagstones of its yard. Its thatch
was loose in places, ruffled like the plumage
of an old stuffed bird, and its garden had been
so long untilled that it had ceased to be the
weed-grown earth patch that a neglected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
garden first becomes, and had grown green all
over, covered itself with grass and fern and
bramble and baby oak-trees, and become just
a fenced-in patch of the wood beyond.</p>

<p>‘Halt!’ said the Police; ‘just the place.
I’ll warrant we’ve run the young gentleman
to earth this time.’</p>

<p>But they hadn’t. There was nothing in
the lodge but an old hamper with a hole in it,
a litter of straw and old damp paper, some
cold ashes in the grate, and in the upper
rooms two last year’s birds’-nests, and a chair
with three legs and half a back.</p>

<p>The Police stooped his helmeted head to
the low door lintel, and came out into the sunshine
a disappointed man.</p>

<p>‘Thought we’d got him,’ he said; and that
was what he said at the thatched summer-house
and in the larch wood, and at various other parts
of the park and grounds where Rupert was not.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it nearly dinner-time?’ Charles asked,
as the search-party pushed through a very
brambly brake and came out once more at the
back of the deserted lodge.</p>

<p>‘Your kind governess, she put back dinner
an hour for you to assist in the search,’ said
the Police reassuringly.</p>

<p>‘Best try the other side, Mr. Poad,’ said
William; ‘you’ve drawed this blank.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I will now whistle to the gentleman as
owns the runaway,’ said the Police suddenly
and terribly, and whistled.</p>

<p>‘Where is he?’ Charlotte asked, with a
sudden vision of the Murdstone gentleman
seeing everything with half an eye, capturing
Rupert and carrying him off in half a minute.
Charles was wondering ‘what they do to you
for helping runaway boys.’</p>

<p>‘Along the road,’ the Police answered,
‘with Mr. Binskin from the Peal of Bells.
Keeping watch. I’d best report to him.’</p>

<p>‘Will he come with us?’ Charles could not
help asking.</p>

<p>‘I’m of opinion he’s best where he is,’ said
the Police. ‘I’m just a-going to tell him to
keep on up and down outside. The ostler
from the Peal is over the other side, case he
gets out that way. Unless he’s had to get
back to his work already.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s go and have another look at those
birds’-nests while we’re waiting,’ said Charlotte,
with great presence of mind. And so it was
through the little diamond panes of the lodge
that they saw again the Murdstone gentleman,
in evening dress and an overcoat, with his
tie in a crumpled state under one ear, and his
face, as Charlotte said, exactly like the face of
a baffled executioner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood talking to the Police for a few
moments, with the old familiar scowl that they
knew so well. They felt like that about it,
though they’d only met the scowler, as you
know, on one occasion. Then he went back
through the gate, and the children, when they
were quite sure that he was gone, rejoined the
Police, rather tired, and feeling as though this
silly game of looking for what they knew, or
at any rate hoped, they weren’t going to find,
had been going on for ever, and seemed as
though it would never stop.</p>

<p>‘I thought it best,’ the Police explained to
William, ‘to keep the gent on the outside of
the place. He seems peppery-natured, and if
he was to spy his boy among your glass-houses,
which is where I propose to conduct my search
in next, I wouldn’t answer for it but what he’d
leap upon him among the glass like a fox at
a duck, and damage untold, as like as not.’</p>

<p>Need I tell you that Rupert was not discovered
among the glass?</p>

<p>Less brisk than at its starting, the search-party
returned to the side door where the
coloured glass was, to be met on its doorstep
by Caroline, rather out of breath and very hot.
She carried her sun-bonnet by its strings (Aunt
Emmeline believed in sun-bonnets and made
dozens of them, as presents for all her friends).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well?’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘We haven’t found him, Miss, if that’s
what you mean,’ said the Police, taking his
helmet off and wiping his face. ‘I suppose
you ain’t seen anything?’</p>

<p>Caroline looked nervously at the others.</p>

<p>‘I <i>heard</i> something,’ she said, ‘in the wood
over there. I went back,’ she went on in a
sort of wooden way—and now she was not
looking at the others at all—‘because I left
something there; and I heard a rustling sound,
and I saw footmarks, in the boggy part of the
wood, and I thought it looked like boy’s boots.’</p>

<p>Charlotte said afterwards that she really
thought she should have burst into little pieces.
And Charles said the same.</p>

<p>To hear their own elder, and till now loved
and esteemed sister, quietly betraying the
refugee, and to be quite unable to say what
they thought of her without having to explain
the lack of candour in their own conduct! It
was a terrible moment.</p>

<p>‘You don’t say so,’ said the Police, and
turned to William. ‘It’s a thirsty job,’ he
added carelessly, and William said he’d ask
indoors.</p>

<p>A tray with glasses and a jug of something
cool resulted. And the Police and William
both seemed the better for it. The gardener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
had retired. It was too far the wrong side of
dinner-time for him, he said.</p>

<p>The Police drew a long breath, and wiped
his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>‘Now then,’ he said; ‘you lead the way,
Miss.’</p>

<p>Caroline led. The others followed. They
could hardly bear to go, yet they could still
less bear to be left behind. Across the hot
sunny grass they went and into the wood. Even
that, though shady, was hot, and there seemed
to be more flies than could possibly be needed
for any useful purpose. Caroline, still carefully
avoiding the eyes of the others, led the
way straight to the ferny lair where they had
left Rupert, the others following in helpless
fury.</p>

<p>‘Hullo!’ said the Police, ‘this looks something
like.’</p>

<p>For there the lair was—plainly to be seen—a
lair and nothing else, but a lair that was
deserted.</p>

<p>‘I think we’re on to him now,’ said the
Police; ‘which way did you say them footstepses
was, Missie?’</p>

<p>‘Farther on,’ said Caroline. ‘I tied my
handkerchief to a tree to mark the place.’</p>

<p>‘You never!’ said the Police admiringly;
‘why, you deserve to be in the Force, Miss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
It’s not every constable, even, would have
thought of that.’</p>

<p>And I believe he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Following Caroline and the Police, pushing
miserably through the bushes that sprang back
as the others passed through and tried to hit
them in the face, Charlotte and Charles exchanged
glances full of meaning.</p>

<p>The whole party made a good deal of noise:
there was the rustling of leaves, both the green
and the dead kind; the snapping of twigs
underfoot; the grating of bough against bough
as the searchers pushed through the hazels and
sweet chestnuts and young oaks.</p>

<p>‘You’d do fine for keepers,’ said William,
coming last. ‘No poachers wouldn’t never hear
<i>you</i> a-coming.’</p>

<p>‘That your handkerchief, Miss?’ the Police
at the same moment asked smartly, and pointed
to a white thing that drooped from a dog-wood
branch; ‘you identify the handkerchief?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Caroline in a stifled voice, ‘and
there’—she pointed down.</p>

<p>There were footprints, very plain and deeply-marked
footprints, not very large, yet not small
like a girl’s. They were the footprints, beyond
any doubt, of a boy.</p>

<p>‘Now we’ve got him,’ said the Police for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
about the fifteenth time that morning, and
proceeded to follow the steps, as was remarked
later, like any old sleuth-hound.</p>

<p>William said, ‘Remarkable deep for the time
of year,’ but nobody took any notice of him.
The boot-boy took a pleasure in planting his
own steps beside the tracks they were following,
till the Police admonished him.</p>

<p>‘Them tracks is evidence,’ he said; ‘you
needn’t tread so nigh them.’</p>

<p>The tracks led them down a steep place, a
sort of gorge, and ended at the tall oak fence.</p>

<p>‘He must have escaped this way,’ said the
Police.</p>

<p>‘I’ll take my Sunday Sam he never,’ said
William.</p>

<p>‘There’s another footprint here,’ said
Caroline anxiously.</p>

<p>‘So there be,’ said the Police. ‘You ’ave
been a ’elp, Miss. I shall name you in my
report.’</p>

<p>It was now seen that a further line of footprints
led along the fence to a place where a
pale was loose.</p>

<p>‘This is where he got through, you may
depend,’ said the Police.</p>

<p>‘I’ll easy wrench another pale loose, if you
want to follow on,’ said William, and as he did
so Charlotte saw him wink, distinctly wink at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a><br /><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a><br /><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Caroline. How hateful everybody was! Oh,
poor Rupert!</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 383px;">
<img src="images/i_122.jpg" width="383" height="586" alt="Constable looking at ground" />
<div class="caption">They were the footprints, beyond any doubt, of a boy.</div>
</div>

<p>Every one got through, Charles and
Charlotte rather doubtfully looking up and
down the road first to see if the Murdstone
master was in sight. ‘Which way?’ the
Police now asked himself and the others
anxiously.</p>

<p>That was quickly settled. A whitish object
lying in the middle of the road ten yards
away, beckoned them to the right. The
Police stooped stiffly, picked it up and
examined its corners.</p>

<p>‘Rupert Wix,’ he read solemnly. ‘I shall
now sound my whistle and acquaint the gentleman
as owns the boy with our discovery of the
ankercher belonging to the runaway.’</p>

<p>But Caroline laid a hand on his arm and
arrested the whistle on its way to his lips.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t that something else white, farther
along?’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Don’t tell me ’e got two ankerchers,’
said William; ‘no boy was ever bred as ’ad
two ankerchers at the one time.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t see nothing,’ said the Police, but
he walked in the direction of Caroline’s gaze.</p>

<p>‘It’s wonderful what eyes you’ve a-got,
Miss,’ said William; ‘none of the rest of us
didn’t spy it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlotte and Charles walked apart from
Caroline in a marked manner.</p>

<p>There certainly was something white in the
road—a piece of paper with a stone on it, and
also, as the Police saw when he picked it up,
writing, pencilled, with that kind of black
blunt pencilledness which happens when you
have a pencil whose point has seen better days,
and you encourage its efforts with your tongue.</p>

<p>‘To any kind Bypasser,’ the Police read
out, ‘please put the inside in the post for me.’</p>

<p>The paper on which this was written was a
leaf torn from a note-book and folded across.
Inside was another leaf with a stamp in the
corner, as though it had been a post-card.
On one side was an address, ‘Mr. and Mrs.
Wix, The Nest, Simla, India,’ and on the other
these lines which the Police read out:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Parents</span>—I am running away to sea
through being so ill-treated by Macpherson. I will
write from the first port. I shall get a ship at
Hastings, I expect.—Your affecate son,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Rupert</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>‘Well!’ said the Police; ‘if that don’t beat
all! Lucky we saw this.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, ain’t it,’ said William, ‘and this the
Hastings road and all. You ought to catch up
easy if you start right away now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I shall now blow my whistle,’ said the
Police as usual, ‘and acquaint the boy’s
guardian with our discovery.’</p>

<p>‘If we can’t be any more use,’ said Caroline
hastily, ‘perhaps you wouldn’t mind our going
back to our dinners. They’ll be getting
dreadfully cold for the time of year,’ she added
a little wildly.</p>

<p>‘Best go back through the gap,’ said William.
‘It ought to be mended, though. Here, you,’
he said to the gardener’s boy, ‘go round by
the lodge and tell Peters to get it seen to.’</p>

<p>‘There is no need to detain you,’ said the
Police, ‘and thanking you for your assistance,
which shall be mentioned in my report. Good
morning to you.’ He blew his whistle and
they hastened back through the gap.</p>

<p>Once through it the others refused to meet
Caroline’s eye. But she did not seem to
notice it.</p>

<p>‘I know listening’s wrong,’ she said; ‘but
when you’re playing detectives the rules are
different, and I should like——’</p>

<p>‘Slip along by the pale, Miss,’ said William.
‘“All’s fair in love an’ war,” as the saying is.’</p>

<p>She slipped, and the others could not help
following her. William went too.</p>

<p>The boots of the Murdstone tutor were
now heard on the road. Then came the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
of the Police, explaining how clever he had
been in finding the footsteps, the handkerchief,
and the letter. ‘And you’d best read the
letter,’ the Police added.</p>

<p>A brief letter-reading silence was broken
by the Murdstone man, very angry indeed.</p>

<p>‘Monstrous!’ he said; ‘and left in the
public road for any stranger to see! Monstrous!
There’s not a word of truth in it.’</p>

<p>‘You can tell that to the Magistrate,’ said
the Police. ‘Beg pardon, sir, I mean I think
I’ve cleared up this little difficulty for you.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose I can get a trap in the village?’
the Murdstone man asked.</p>

<p>‘At the Green Dragon, sir.’</p>

<p>‘Right,’ said Mr. Macpherson smartly.
‘Good morning!’ And he turned and walked
quickly away, leaving the Police planted there,
as they say in France.</p>

<p>‘Well—I’m—dished!’ said the Police aloud,
after a moment’s silence, to what he supposed
to be solitude; ‘not so much as tuppence to
drink his blooming bad health in. The stingy
blighter! He can look for his own boys after
this. And I hope the young ’un gets off, so I
do.’</p>

<p>‘Same here,’ whispered William behind the
grey oak paling.</p>

<p>The Police walked heavily away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Best go in to dinner,’ said William, and
the four walked in silence across the park.
When they got to the side door William
spoke.</p>

<p>‘You’re a fair masterpiece, Miss Caroline,’
he said; ‘that I will say.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>Charles and Charlotte both felt—they
owned it afterwards—almost choked by all
the things they wanted to say to Caroline and
couldn’t, because of William. They drew
long breaths and almost snorted with mixed
emotions.</p>

<p>‘I say,’ said Caroline eagerly, as William
turned away. But Charles interrupted.</p>

<p>‘We don’t mean to speak to you,’ he said.</p>

<p>And just then Mrs. Wilmington appeared
at the door, and no one could say anything
further; anything that mattered, that is.</p>

<p>She escorted the girls to their room. In
her superior lady-like way she was curious
about the missing boy. Charlotte told the
story briefly, while Caroline buried her hot
face in a big basin of cold water and blew like a
grampus. Then there was dinner, and Mrs.
Wilmington stayed all through that to hear
more details. When dinner was over Caroline
disappeared.</p>

<p>‘I expect she’s gone away to cry,’ Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
whispered to her brother. ‘I say, I wish we
hadn’t. But we did agree we oughtn’t to
speak to a traitor till it was sorry: you said
so yourself in the wood.’</p>

<p>‘It’s all very beastly,’ said Charles. ‘I wish
it hadn’t happened, upsetting everything.’</p>

<p>‘I say,’ Charlotte said, ‘let’s forgive her
now. I expect she thought she was doing
right, being like a Spartan boy or something.
Caro is silly like that sometimes. Let’s go
and find her and forgive her, and talk it all
over comfortably, the three of us.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t mind,’ said Charles; ‘let’s find her,
if you like.’</p>

<p>But they couldn’t find her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE HEROINE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was William who, when they had searched
house and garden and park for nearly an hour,
greeted the two as they trailed forlornly into
the stable-yard on the last wild chance of
finding her there. By this time both were
thoroughly sorry and remorseful, and very
anxious indeed to know what had become of
their sister.</p>

<p>‘I suppose you haven’t seen Caroline anywhere
about?’ they said to William, who was
sitting in the harness-room door, with a rose in
his button-hole, smoking a black clay pipe.</p>

<p>‘She was out in the garden a bit back,’
he said; ‘give me this ’ere button-hole.
She’s a sister to be proud on, she is.’</p>

<p>‘Why?’ asked Charles blankly.</p>

<p>‘What she done this morning,’ William
answered.</p>

<p>‘I suppose she thought it was right.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’ know about right,’ said William,
scratching his ear. ‘Anyhow she went down
along towards where you was messing about
in the wood this morning. Just after dinner
she went with a book under her arm and her
pinny full of roses. I’m coming along that
way myself when I’ve finished my pipe.’</p>

<p>Charlotte and Charles went down slowly
to the wood, and they were both very uncomfortable.
However right Caroline might
have been....</p>

<p>‘I can’t understand how she <i>can</i>—the very
place where <i>he</i> was—all safe only this morning,’
said Charlotte, and walked slower than ever.
They went so slowly that William had almost
caught them up before they had reached the
wood.</p>

<p>Just before they turned in among the
dappled shadows of the wood, Charles said,
‘Did you hear that?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charlotte; ‘it’s only Caro talking
to herself.’ And they went on. They did not
hear any more talking, and when they reached
the lair Caroline was sitting there silent with a
splash of red rose colour beside her among the
fern.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Caro!’ cried Charlotte, almost weeping
and flumping down beside her sister; ‘I’m
sorry we were horrid. We see now you must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
have thought you were being Spartan-boyish
or something. And it’s too perfectly horrid.
And do let’s make it up; do.’</p>

<p>‘I did think you’d more sense,’ said Caroline,
but she kissed Charlotte too, ‘or that you’d
know that I had—more sense, I mean. And
directly I began to tell you, you said <i>That</i>.’
She sniffed. It was plain that she had been
crying.</p>

<p>Charles sat down. ‘I’m sorry too,’ he said
handsomely. ‘Now let’s talk about something
else. Our only hope is to forget poor
Rupert.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll try to forget him,’ Charlotte said; ‘but
he <i>was</i> such a nice boy. I suppose you had to
do it, Caro. But, oh, I do wish he was back
again.’</p>

<p>Here Charlotte began to cry.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t!’ said Caroline, putting her arm
round her; ‘do you mean to say you don’t
understand yet? I’d no idea you could be so
silly.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t think she’s silly at all,’ said Charles
loyally. ‘<i>I</i> wish he was here too.’</p>

<p>‘He <i>is</i> here,’ said Caroline in an exasperated
whisper; ‘just behind you. We thought you
might be some one else, so he hid. Come back,
Rupert; it’s only them.’</p>

<p>And from the tangled thicket Rupert put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
forth a head very rough as to the hair, which
bristled with twigs and pine-needles.</p>

<p>‘Then you didn’t run away to sea?’</p>

<p>‘Not much,’ Rupert answered, leaning on
his elbows and showing only the head and
shoulders part of him.</p>

<p>‘But the letter said——’</p>

<p>‘That was <i>her</i>,’ Rupert explained, pointing
at Caroline with his head. (That looks odd
when you read it, but if you try, you will find
that it is quite easy to do.) ‘That was her.
It was all her. I’ll never say anything about
girls being muffs again. She absolutely ran
the show. She’s a brick.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, shut up,’ said Caroline with hot ears.</p>

<p>‘But <i>what</i> did she do?’</p>

<p>‘Took them off the scent. Tell them all
about it,’ said Rupert.</p>

<p>‘No, you,’ said Caroline, rolling over and
burrowing her nose among the roses.</p>

<p>‘Well, it was like this. After you’d gone
off, I was in a blue funk, and I don’t mind owning
it. And when she came back I thought it was
the Police, and about all being lost except
honour—and precious little of that. Then she
explained it all to me, and I got my boots off.’</p>

<p>‘Explained <i>what?</i>’ Charles had to ask.</p>

<p>‘Her plan, you duffer; her glorious Sherlock-Holmes
plan.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You <i>might</i> have told us,’ Charlotte couldn’t
help saying.</p>

<p>‘How could I? All among William and the
Police?’</p>

<p>‘Well, go on.’</p>

<p>‘She’d got her pocket-book, and I wrote that
letter. She thought of that too. And I gave
her my hankey, and she carried my boots off in
her hand, and when she got to the swampy
place she put them on and made the footmarks.’</p>

<p>‘I stamped them in as deep as I could,’
Caroline broke in, ‘and I found the fence and
got out and put the letter, and simply tore back
round by the lodge. Didn’t you notice how
hot I was? I saw the Murdstone man, but I’d
got my sun-bonnet. He was cutting the heads
off nettles with his stick like some one in the
French Revolution.’</p>

<p>‘And she led them off the scent completely.
They’d have been certain to find me here, with
the fern all trampled about. She thought of
that too,’ Rupert said.</p>

<p>‘But where were you then?’</p>

<p>‘Up that tree.’ He pointed to a leafy beech.
‘I saw you all go by, your Police with his nose
on the ground like any old hound. Not one
of you looked up. She’s a regular A1, first-class
brick, if you ask me. And now if you
can hide me a bit here till I’ve written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to my people and got an answer—— Yes,
she is a brick. And I shall always stand
up for it that bricks are bricks even if they’re
only girls.’</p>

<p>‘You do make such a fuss,’ said Caroline,
delighted with his praise and trying not to be,
and feeling it the duty of a modest heroine to
turn the subject. ‘And now I thought we’d be
the Royal Order of the Secret Rose. The rose
is the emblem of secrecy. Two buds and a
full-blowner you have to wear. It’s the badge.’</p>

<p>She chose flowers and buds from the crimson
heap and presented them to the others. The
needed pins she produced from the front of her
pinafore.</p>

<p>‘I’ve got one too,’ said Rupert, grinning
from his covert. ‘A badge, I mean, and——’</p>

<p>‘Hush!’ whispered Charlotte; ‘there’s some
one coming. It’s William!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that’s all right,’ Caroline said amazingly.
‘William knows. He’s one of us.
He’s wearing the Royal Rose too.’</p>

<p>‘And he isn’t going to tell?’ Charles could
hardly believe it of a grown-up.</p>

<p>‘No, he ain’t a-going to tell’; it was William
who answered, pushing through the leaves and
sitting down squarely on a stump. ‘I don’t
give away a good sport like what Miss Caroline
is—not me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But when did you find out?’ Charlotte
asked.</p>

<p>‘I had my suspicions from the first—Miss
Caroline going off so artful. And then when
she come back, of course I knew.’</p>

<p>‘Why “of course”?’ Charles wanted to know.</p>

<p>‘Well, nobody except the Pleece would
cotton to it as a young lady like Miss Caroline
would set out to give away a runaway dog as
’ad trusted her, let alone a young gentleman.’</p>

<p>Charlotte and Charles never wish to feel
less pleased with themselves than they did
then.</p>

<p>‘An’ the bootmarks,’ William went on;
‘much too deep and plain they was for anybody
as was out to get off, with somebody arter
them. Let alone as I see a bit of young
master’s jacket up in the tree as we come over
the park. And the ankercher dropped so
handy. Not but what I own I thought it was
all up when we come to that letter. I did
think that was a bit too thick. As if people on
the bolt ’ud stop to write letters and lay them
convenient like in the middles of roads. I
thought you’d killed the cat with kindness that
time. But no—’e swallowed it all, old Poad
did, like mother’s milk it went down. And so
did the schoolmaster. And off ’e goes. And
off <i>he</i> goes. And off <i>you</i> goes to your dinners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and I come along to the young chap in the tree
and fetches him a bite of something, and
whistles him down that all’s serene. And Miss
Caroline she comes along and makes me a
member of her ancient order of Rosy Buffaloes,
or whatever it is, and here we are as jolly as
you please, and safe as you please. Only my
advice is, tell the Master.’</p>

<p>‘We can’t,’ said Caroline earnestly. ‘It
wouldn’t be fair. He might think it was his
duty, or something——’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Charles, relieved; ‘we’re not the
only ones. We thought that of <i>you</i>. It’s just
the same.’</p>

<p>‘There’s only one difference,’ said Caroline—and
this was the only time she hit back
that day, so we may forgive her for it—‘one
difference, and that is that I’m right and you
were wrong.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ said Charles blankly.</p>

<p>‘Best tell the Master.’ William’s tone was
persuasive.</p>

<p>‘You said you were ours to the death.’</p>

<p>‘You asked me if I was, and I wasn’t going
to contradict a lady,’ William corrected. ‘And
as far as keeping my tongue betwixt my teeth,
and lending a hand in the victualling depart:
and a rug and a truss in the straw-loft that
I’ve got the key of, and where the Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a><br /><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a><br /><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
hisself wouldn’t presume to show a nose—as
far as that goes, I’m your man. More especially
since I seen your governors, teachers,
pastors, and masters in that nasty white rage
with his face all twisted. I wouldn’t ‘and over
a blind kitten to <i>’is</i> tender mercies. But my
advice is——’</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 378px;">
<img src="images/i_138.jpg" width="378" height="588" alt="boy in tree, man on ground" />
<div class="caption">‘Fetches him a bite of something.’</div>
</div>

<p>‘Don’t!’ Caroline implored; ‘because really
we can’t, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I must be getting along,’ said William,
rising stiffly; ‘I ain’t talked so much since the
election. And I wasn’t a-going to say what you
thought I was a-going to say. What I was
a-going to say was, get out of this. It’s all
trampled, and some one’s sure to notice—if it’s
only that Jim. You go deeper into the wood,
and come night-time I’ll fetch him away and
bed him down all right. So long!’</p>

<p>He tramped away, crunching sticks and
stalks as he went.</p>

<p>‘How glorious,’ Charlotte said slowly, ‘to
have a real live heroine for your sister.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but,’ Charles asked anxiously, ‘are
you sure William will keep the secret?’</p>

<p>‘I’d answer for him with my life,’ said
Rupert. ‘You don’t know how jolly he was
when he brought me the bread and cheese, and
water in a medicine bottle. It tasted a little
of camphor. Awfully decent chap he is!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>‘He can’t help keeping the secret,’ Caroline
spoke with impressive earnestness; ‘he wears
the Royal Rose and the twin buds, the badge
of secrecy. If you wear <i>that</i> you simply can’t
betray a secret. It says so in the <i>Language
Of</i>, page 37.’</p>

<p>She picked up the book from under the
roses, fluttered its leaves, found page 37 and
read:</p>

<p>‘“The red or damask rose, full-blown and
worn with two of its own buds, is the emblem
and pledge of inviolet”—inviolable, I mean—“secrecy,
and he who wears the Royal Queen of
flowers accompanied by two unopened promises
of her future magnificence, by this eloquent
symbol binds himself to preserve uncontaminated
the secret trust reposed in him by
the more delicate and fragile portion—fragile
and delicate as the lovely flower which is the
subject of our remarks—of the human race.”’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Charlotte, relieved; ‘then he
can’t tell, even if he wants to.’</p>

<p>‘If the book knows,’ Charles added.</p>

<p>‘Well, it’s all right, you know,’ said Rupert,
‘because I’m a judge of human nature, and I
know that William is the soul of honour, and
wouldn’t want to tell even if he could.’</p>

<p>‘So that’s all right.’ Charlotte breathed
deeply. ‘I say, Rupert, aren’t you afraid?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What of?’</p>

<p>‘The Police.’</p>

<p>Rupert laughed. ‘I think William was
right,’ he said, wriggling out a little farther
from the fern so that the red rose in his button-hole
burst suddenly upon public view; ‘if the
Police would swallow that letter they’d swallow
anything. And if the eyes of the whole <i>vox
populi</i> were upon me,’ he ended with a grand
if vague remembrance of old Mug’s careful
teaching, ‘Caroline would find a <i>via media</i>, or
way out.’</p>

<p>‘Rats!’ said Caroline briefly.</p>

<p>‘I say!’ said Charles, gazing awe-struck,
‘what a jolly lot of Latin you know!’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE MORNING AFTER</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">Wake</span> up!’ whispered Charlotte, sitting up
very wide awake and pinching her sister
gently but firmly.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ Caroline asked, very warm and
sleepy. ‘We aren’t called yet, and it’s quite
dark.’</p>

<p>‘Called!’ Charlotte echoed in contempt.
‘And the curtains aren’t drawn, so of course
it’s dark. Wake up, silly; don’t you remember?’</p>

<p>‘All right!’ Caroline murmured, and went
to sleep again.</p>

<p>‘You can’t have forgotten yesterday, and
how we were detectives, and you were Sherlock
Holmes wrong way out, and about Rupert,
Rupert, Rupert?’</p>

<p>And at that Caroline did wake up, and sat
up in bed and rubbed her eyes.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it glorious?’ Charlotte asked, jumping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
up and down on the bed; ‘our splendid secret
and the rose and everything? I do think we’re
lucky, don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so,’ Caroline answered, yawning;
‘but what are we going to do with him?’</p>

<p>‘Conceal him, of course,’ Charlotte answered
briskly, ‘and answer for him with our lives.
Until the answer comes to the Indian letter.’</p>

<p>‘The letter didn’t go, you know,’ Caroline
reminded her, and put one foot out of bed.</p>

<p>‘What’s the matter with you?’ Charlotte
asked. ‘You don’t seem a bit keen.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t feel keen,’ Caroline answered. ‘I
wish it hadn’t happened. I feel as if I didn’t
want to do anything but to be quiet and have
nothing happen, like it used to. My inside
mind feels quite stiff and sore.’</p>

<p>‘That’s using it so much yesterday; being
so clever, you know. Of course your mind
feels stiff. It isn’t used to it,’ said Charlotte
brightly, bounced off the bed and ran to draw
the curtains. ‘Oh!’ she said, and stood quite
still with the curtain in her hand.</p>

<p>‘What?’ Caroline asked anxiously, for the
tone was tragic.</p>

<p>‘It’s raining,’ said Charlotte; ‘that’s all.
Hard.’</p>

<p>‘How awful,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>Somehow no one had expected it to rain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
The sun had shone now for days and days, and
it had seemed as though it must always go on
shining.</p>

<p>‘Rupert won’t be able to hide in the wood,
will he?’ said Charlotte after a dismal silence.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Charlotte,’ said Caroline in deep reproach,
holding up her little silver watch, ‘it’s
only a quarter to five. I’m going to sleep
again. You know how thin and rotten you
feel in the afternoon if you get up too early.
Come on. Perhaps it won’t be raining when
it’s proper getting-up time.’</p>

<p>But it was, as hard as ever. And it was
a dismal little breakfast-party. The dining-room,
usually so sunny and delightful at this
hour, was sombre and brown and dull. The
books all looked like lesson-books, and even
the portrait of the Lady with the ruff had but
little interest for the children. It seemed as
though some one had turned off all sunshine
and all magic at the very meter.</p>

<p>Anxiety about Rupert mingled with the
usual wet-day feelings, and every one was at
first too miserable even to tell the others how
miserable it was.</p>

<p>Almost in silence Caroline poured out the
milk, Charles served the bacon, and Charlotte
handed the toast. And quite in silence they
ate and drank. But breakfast soon began it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>s
healing work, and before it came to the marmalade,
Charlotte was able to say:</p>

<p>‘This is the time to do something desperate.
I’ll have some tea, please, Caro. Aunt
Emmeline says it’s a dreadful drug and people
take it instead of beer. I don’t like it,’ she
hastened to add. ‘It’s only to show how
desperate we are.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but your drinking tea won’t help
Rupert. He’ll be soaked in the woods,’ said
Caroline heavily.</p>

<p>‘Still, he’ll be safe,’ Charles pointed out.
‘No one will go looking for him in the sopping
wet. I’ll have tea too. Let’s call it a carouse
in the smugglers’ cave.’</p>

<p>But the others thought this was going a
little too far.</p>

<p>‘I don’t feel as if we ought to play till
we know about Rupert and whether he’s had
any breakfast. And I know the Wilming-cat
won’t let us go out in the rain,’ Charlotte
said.</p>

<p>‘One of us must go out and see William,
that’s all,’ said Caroline. ‘I’ll go if you like,
and chance the Wil-cat. No; we can’t all go.
People notice you so much more if there’s a
lot of you.’</p>

<p>Thus William at work in the harness-room
was visited by a small figure in a damp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
mackintosh and a red tam-o’-shanter frosted
with raindrops.</p>

<p>‘Where is he?’ it whispered, ‘and has he
had his breakfast?’</p>

<p>‘Now you be off, Miss,’ said William, very
loud and plain. ‘I ain’t up to talking so early.
My jaws is hung crooked with talking so much
yesterday. Be off with you.’ As he spoke he
pulled a piece of chalk from his pocket and
wrote on the table:</p>

<p>‘Come at 12,’ and smeared it out with his
cuff, just as the gardener came to the door and
said:</p>

<p>‘Don’t look like clearing up.’</p>

<p>Caroline understood.</p>

<p>‘We shall be wanting some flowers,’ she
said, ‘to send in a letter. And it’s too wet to
go and get them. I thought perhaps William
would.’</p>

<p>‘Flowers ain’t William’s business, nor yet
his pleasure,’ said the gardener, ‘or he
wouldn’t ’ave a dead un in his button-hole like
what he’s got.’ He pointed to William’s coat,
hanging on a saddle-perch and still bearing in
its button-hole the withered rose of secrecy.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps <i>you</i> would, then?’ Caroline suggested.
‘I want four red roses, no—five, and
ten buds. And is there any stephanotis? I
think it means absent friends.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, there ain’t,’ said the gardener.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, traveller’s joy. That means
safety.’</p>

<p>‘Plenty of that—nasty weed,’ said the
gardener, but not unkindly. ‘Right you are,
Miss. I’ll bring ’em to the dining-room
window to save my boots on cook’s flagstones.’</p>

<p>‘So that’s all right,’ said Caroline, returning
to the others. ‘We’re to go at twelve. Only
now we must write to Aunt Emmeline and
send her the traveller’s joy, because I said
we wanted to send it in a letter. Yes, you
must, too, Charles. We shall be doing an
unselfish act, because I’m sure no one wants
to write to Aunt Emmeline, and she says unselfishness
makes the sun shine on the cloudiest
days.’</p>

<p>‘All right, we’ll try it on,’ said Charles, but
not hopefully; and soon there was a deep
stillness, broken only by the slow scratching of
pens.</p>

<p>Presently the gardener brought the roses
and clematis to the window.</p>

<p>‘That’s what you want?’ he asked, handing
in the wet red and green bouquet.</p>

<p>‘Quite,’ said Caroline; ‘and do you know
it’s just as well you hadn’t any stephanotis,
because I see it doesn’t mean what I thought
it meant. It means ‘Will you accompany me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to the East?’ and Aunt Emmeline would have
been so upset wondering what we meant.’</p>

<p>‘She wouldn’t ’a been the only one,’ said
the gardener, and clumped away on those boots
which were not considered suitable for cook’s
flagstones.</p>

<p>When the letters were done, it was only
eleven o’clock, and it was decided that, as
Rupert must have had his breakfast, it wouldn’t
be unfeeling to play desert islands, just to pass
the time till it should be twelve.</p>

<p>The dining-room table made an excellent
island, and the arm-chair was a ship which held
the three of them, and could, with reasonable
care, be wrecked quite safely on the deep
waters of the hearth-rug. The card-table from
the window, turned wrong way up, made a
charming raft; and the girls’ pinafores, fastened
to the poker and tongs, did for sails. You
steered with the fire-shovel and brought bags
of biscuit (which looked like cushions) from the
good vessel, the <i>Golden Vanity</i>, which, disguised
as the sofa, lay derelict across the
Carpet Bay. It was a grand game, and when
some one began to say ‘Twelve o’clock,’ the
shipwrecked sailors were quite astonished.
The person who began to say ‘Twelve,’ was, of
course, the tall clock with the silver face inlaid
with golden roses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We ought to go at once,’ said Caroline,
putting the masts back in the fender; ‘but if
we leave everything like this, the Wil-cat——’</p>

<p>‘We’ll clear up,’ said Charlotte with a noble
effort, ‘to make up for being beastly yesterday.
You go, Caro. We’ll come out as soon as
we’ve done, and stand in the door till you tell
us it’s all right.’</p>

<p>‘That’s jolly decent of her,’ Charles told
Caroline. ‘And I say the same.’</p>

<p>‘Jolly decent of <i>you</i>,’ said Caroline, and
went.</p>

<p>It was still raining. Caroline stood at the
back door with a rose and two buds in her hand,
and watched the rain splashing in the puddles
and on to the sack-covered shoulders of the
gardener and the gardener’s boy and the stable
boy as they went off to their dinners. As soon
as she could be quite sure that they had really
gone and wouldn’t be likely to come back for
anything they’d forgotten, she ran across to the
harness-room.</p>

<p>‘Here’s your new secret rose,’ she said, ‘and
now can I see Rupert? The others’ll be out
directly.’</p>

<p>‘Go and tell them to stay where they be,’
said William crossly; ‘there won’t be much
secret rosing left if you’re all hanging about
here. And Mrs. What’s-her-name’s equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to a bit of secret nosing herself, if you come to
that. Hurry up now, afore they comes along.’</p>

<p>The others were not pleased, but they had
to own that most likely William knew best.</p>

<p>Thus it was Caroline alone who followed
William through the stable and up the ladder
into the straw-loft, which at first seemed to
have nothing in it but straw, very dark in the
corners and very yellow under the skylight.</p>

<p>‘Where is he?’ Caroline asked, and the
straw rustled and opened, revealing Rupert,
rather tousled and strawy about the head, and
the bright eyes and black ears of a small fox-terrier.</p>

<p>‘I hid when I heard you on the ladder,’ he
said. ‘You can’t be too careful.’ He spoke
in a low hoarse voice.</p>

<p>‘Now I’ll keep about down in the stable,’
said William, ‘and if I whistle, you lay low.’</p>

<p>He retreated down the ladder, and they
heard him say ‘Over’ to one of the horses.</p>

<p>‘I wish <i>this</i> was over,’ said Rupert, rather
fretfully.</p>

<p>‘It is beastly having it rain,’ said Caroline
sympathetically; ‘but it’ll be fine to-morrow, I
expect, and I’ve brought you a secrecy rose.’
He took it and said ‘Thank you!’ but not
enthusiastically. ‘And,’ she went on—‘wait
till I get it out—it’s rather a tight fit for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a><br /><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a><br /><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
pocket—I’ve brought you <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and
a pencil and paper to really write to your father
and mother. And I’ll post it as soon as the
rain stops.’</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 376px;">

<div class="caption">‘If I whistle, you lay low.’</div>
</div>

<p>‘Well, you are a brick,’ he said. ‘I shall be
all right with something to read. But you’ve
simply no idea how slow time goes when you’re
in concealment. I can’t think how those
Royalist chaps stood it as they did; and the
Man in the Iron Mask and Sir Walter Raleigh
and Mary Queen Of.’</p>

<p>‘I <i>am</i> sorry,’ said Caroline again. ‘How
long will it take to get an answer from India?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, weeks,’ said Rupert wearily. ‘I was
just thinking I couldn’t stick it, and perhaps I’d
better really run away to sea, only not Hastings,
of course. But it doesn’t seem so bad now I’ve
got the book, and Pincher’s rather jolly, and you
too, of course,’ he added with sudden politeness.</p>

<p>‘Tell me all about last night.’ Caroline
settled comfortably into a nest of straw. ‘What
happened after we left you?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, William came and brought me in and
gave me a rug and the dog and some more
bread and cheese. And bread and bacon this
morning.’</p>

<p>‘I say, you <i>are</i> hoarse.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it’s nothing. I say, don’t think me a
pig, but I should like something to <i>eat</i>. I feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
as if I’d been eating bread and cheese and cold
bacon for long years, and it’s all fat—the bacon
is, I mean.’</p>

<p>Caroline said how stupid it was of her and
she’d bring him something when the men went
home to their teas. And then suddenly there
seemed to be nothing more to say.</p>

<p>There was a silence, broken by Rupert’s
putting his head under the blanket to cough in
a suppressed manner.</p>

<p>‘I hope you haven’t taken a chill,’ said
Caroline with motherly anxiety. ‘Aunt Emmeline
says you never take them if you keep your
windows open at night; but of course you can’t
here, because there aren’t any.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Rupert. ‘I say, do you play
chess, or draughts, or halma or anything?’</p>

<p>‘I could bring them,’ she said; ‘but I only
know the moves at chess and when you bring
down the Queen and the Bishop, and the other
person is called the Fool’s Mate—only they
always see it before you get it finished.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll teach you,’ said Rupert yawning. ‘I
say, everything is pretty beastly, isn’t it? It’s
jolly in India. I wish I was there.’</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ said Caroline. ‘At least I don’t
mean that. But I wish you were not so
mizzy.’</p>

<p>‘There ought to be a Society for the Prevention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of Schools,’ Rupert went on; ‘then
everything would be all right.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Caroline; ‘I think
this is a dumpy day. I felt quite flat this
morning, as if nothing mattered. But it got
better. I’ll look in my book when I get back
and see if there’s any flower that means cheer
up. And if there is I’ll bring it to you, and
perhaps it will work a cheering charm on you.’</p>

<p>Caroline herself, sitting among the straw,
wrinkling her forehead in the effort to think of
some way of cheering the prisoner, was almost
a cheering charm herself. Rupert perhaps felt
something of this, for he said:</p>

<p>‘I’m all right. Only I feel so jolly rotten.’</p>

<p>‘You write the letter,’ said Caroline. ‘I
don’t feel half as flat as I did. I’ll think of all
sorts of things to amuse the captive. And I’ll
bring you——’</p>

<p>William whistled below. The two children
stiffened to the stillness of stone and held their
breaths. Voices. Mrs. Wilmington’s voice.</p>

<p>‘Have you seen Miss Caroline, William?’ she
was saying. ‘I am afraid she has run out in the
reen.’</p>

<p>‘She’s up in the loft, Mum,’ said William.
‘I let her go up just to ’ave a peep. ’Ere,
Miss, you come along down. You seen all
there is to see.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Caroline rustled through the straw and down
the ladder. Mrs. Wilmington, cloaked and
with a brown plaid shawl over her head, stood
in the stable door.</p>

<p>‘I’m quite dry, really I am,’ said Caroline,
as William climbed the ladder to padlock the
trap-door.</p>

<p>‘You best come in at once,’ said Mrs.
Wilmington. And at that moment a faint
sound was heard from the loft. Rupert had
coughed again.</p>

<p>‘What’s that?’ Mrs. Wilmington asked,
pausing on one galosh to listen.</p>

<p>‘My dawg’s up there,’ said William; ‘’e
catches rats now and again.’</p>

<p>‘It was a strange noise for a dog,’ said the
housekeeper with a thoughtful air.</p>

<p>‘Weren’t it now?’ said William admiringly.
‘Can’t think ’ow they does it! You wouldn’t
believe the noises dogs make when they’re
after rats. It’s the way it takes ’em, you
see.’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Mrs. Wilmington, and turned
away, picking her galoshed steps delicately,
and followed by Caroline, who now ventured
to breathe again, and splashed in all the
puddles.</p>

<p>‘Your uncle,’ said the housekeeper, taking
off her shawl and shaking it at the back door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
‘was inquiring for you. He does not weesh
you to go out in the reen.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘And I always understood,’ said the housekeeper,
‘that young ladies was, were, better
away from low company.’</p>

<p>‘If you mean William,’ began Caroline
hotly, but Mrs. Wilmington interrupted her
with—</p>

<p>‘I mean dogs in straw-lofts. Now you
know.’</p>

<p>Caroline decided to get Mrs. Wilmington
a soothing bouquet as soon as the rain cleared
off.</p>

<p>‘Your uncle’s in the dining-room,’ said the
housekeeper. ‘Wipe your shoes on the mat,
please.’</p>

<p>From the dining-room came the sound of
talking. Caroline heard:</p>

<p>‘You see, uncle, you just sit on the wreck
and we’ll come and rescue you with the raft.’</p>

<p>She paused in the doorway. Could it be
true that the Uncle was playing? No, it could
not.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said the Uncle; ‘I feel safer
on the wreck. I’m glad you’ve been having
a game,’ he said, blinking kindly at her.</p>

<p>‘I hope you don’t mind the room being a
little untidy, uncle,’ said Caroline. For, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the others had decided that the clearing-up
bargain was off, and had gone on with the
game.</p>

<p>‘Not at all, if you don’t break things,’ he
said a little nervously.</p>

<p>‘We’re most <i>awfully</i> careful,’ Charles explained.
‘You see we keep the raft on the
carpet for fear of scratching it.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> think it polishes it, being dragged about
on this Turkish sea,’ Charlotte told them.</p>

<p>‘And so you’re not dull, even on this rainy
day? I feared you might find it wearisome.’</p>

<p>‘Oh <i>no</i>,’ said every one; ‘it’s the loveliest
house in the world.’ And Charlotte asked
him kindly how his magic was getting on.</p>

<p>‘Poorly,’ he said; ‘poorly. And yours?’</p>

<p>There was a silence, full of the thoughts of
the magic of fern-seed and of the great Rupert-secret.</p>

<p>‘We’ve invented a Secret Society,’ Caroline
said difficultly and in haste: ‘the Secret Society
of the Rose. You wear one full blown rose
and two buds, you see.’</p>

<p>‘I see. And what is the secret?’ asked the
innocent and kindly uncle.</p>

<p>Everyone became scarlet except the Uncle,
who looked more like oyster shells than ever,
and said:</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We’d tell you in a minute if we could. But
you see it <i>is</i> a Secret Society.’</p>

<p>‘I see. I am very sorry I was so indiscreet.
But tell me this,’ he added hastily. ‘You
haven’t broken anything, have you?’</p>

<p>‘Not a thing.’</p>

<p>‘I thought you wouldn’t,’ the Uncle assured
them. ‘Mrs. Wilmington was of opinion that
you would break almost everything in the
house. But that was before she saw you, of
course. If you <i>do</i> break anything you’ll tell
me, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ they answered in various tones
of surprise.</p>

<p>‘Quite so. I might have known. I wish
I could do something to amuse you. If you
had any friends in the neighbourhood you
might have the carriage and drive out to see
them. But of course you have no acquaintances
here.’</p>

<p>‘The clergyman is a friend of ours,’ Charles
remarked.</p>

<p>And Caroline said if only they might go
and see him.</p>

<p>‘By all means,’ said the Uncle; ‘bring him
back to tea with you. I am sincerely glad
to find that you are making yourselves at
home.’</p>

<p>With that he went away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Do you think that was snarkasm? About
making ourselves at home?’ Charles asked.</p>

<p>‘Not it,’ Charlotte assured him. ‘I’m sure
the Uncle’s open as the day.’</p>

<p>‘All the same we’d better clear up,’ said
Charlotte, and on the word Harriet came in
to lay the cloth. Mrs. Wilmington followed.
And it was she who cleared up, with pinched
lips and a marked abstaining from reproaches.</p>

<p>The children dined alone, and the cook
remarked on the sudden growth of their
appetites. How was she to know that generous
double helpings of beef, Yorkshire pudding,
potatoes, summer cabbage, rhubarb pie and
custard were hidden behind the books on the
dining-room shelf, for the later refreshment of
a runaway boy at present lurking in the straw-loft?</p>

<p>‘We must put the things in tumblers,’
Caroline said, ‘because plates would be missed;
but the tumblers live in the sideboard, and
there are dozens.’</p>

<p>So a row of tumblers, containing such
greasy things as never before had profaned
their limpid depths, stood in a row like beakers
on the bench of a secret laboratory.</p>

<p>‘It’s all very well,’ said Charlotte, replacing
the last book and ringing the bell, ‘but how
shall we get them to him?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>‘William will manage it at tea-time,’ Caroline
was sure.</p>

<p>‘But we’ve got to bring the clergyman
home to tea.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, bother!’ was the remark that sprang
to the lips of Caroline. ‘I never thought of
that.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>BREWING THE SPELL</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was awkward, certainly. And the awkwardness
kept worrying and worrying at the back
of Caroline’s mind all through the pleasure of
going out in the carriage to make a call by
themselves, and the delight of the call, which
was diversified by peppermints, a fine collection
of butterflies, and being allowed to try and
play the harmonium.</p>

<p>It was while Charles and Charlotte were
busy with this in the large bare room which
had been the last rector’s drawing-room, and
was now used for all sorts of parish parties,
that Mr. Penfold took Caroline into the conservatory
to show her a pet newt.</p>

<p>‘A friend of mine with an orange waistcoat,’
Mr. Penfold said.</p>

<p>He was a very nice newt, but even his
orange-coloured stomach could not drive away
the worries from the back of Caroline’s mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
How were the tumblers of food to be got to
Rupert? Altogether she felt worried; the
whole adventure was beginning to feel too big
and too serious. And when Mr. Penfold,
suddenly asking her if she could keep a secret,
showed her a green parrot sitting on a nest
behind a big geranium, she longed to say that
she would keep his, and to tell him her own.</p>

<p>What she did say when she had admired
the parrot was:</p>

<p>‘You’re a clergyman, and so I suppose you
know all about right and wrong?’</p>

<p>‘I do my best to know,’ he said. ‘Well?’</p>

<p>‘Well, aren’t there some secrets you ought
to keep, even if you know that some people
would say you oughtn’t to if they were to
know you were keeping them—only of course
they don’t?’</p>

<p>I think it was rather clever of Mr. Penfold
to understand this; but he did.</p>

<p>‘There are some things we all have to
judge for ourselves,’ he said. ‘Could you
give me an instance of the sort of thing you
mean? Not the real thing you were thinking
about, of course; but something like it.’</p>

<p>‘Of course not the real thing,’ she said,
and paused.</p>

<p>The temptation to be very clever came to
her. She would tell him the real thing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
he would never think it could be the real
one.</p>

<p>‘Well, suppose,’ she said slowly, and
stopped.</p>

<p>‘Suppose?’</p>

<p>‘You heard about that boy who ran away,
and they were looking for him yesterday?’</p>

<p>‘He wasn’t found, was he?’ the clergyman
asked, carefully picking dead leaves from a
salmon-coloured fuchsia.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Caroline. ‘Well, suppose the
boy had come to you, what would you have
done? You wouldn’t have given him up,
would you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know any of the facts of the case,’
he answered slowly.</p>

<p>‘But suppose it was a runaway slave.’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not.’</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘But, you see, it wouldn’t stop with not
giving him up. He would have to be fed and
clothed, and have somewhere to sleep, and it
would be impossible, quite impossible, to keep
him concealed. They would be sure to find
him.’</p>

<p>‘Ye-es,’ said Caroline; ‘but what could
you do?’</p>

<p>‘Well, leaving the boy out of the question—he
was just given as an instance, wasn’t he—suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a><br /><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a><br /><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
<i>you</i> were in any other sort of
difficulty, the thing for you to do would be to
tell your uncle. You take it from me, you
can trust him absolutely. He’ll decide what’s
right. Unless you’d like to tell me. I’d help
all I could.’</p>

<div class="caption">Showed her a green parrot sitting on a nest.</div>
</div>

<p>‘If ever I have a secret I <i>can</i> tell you, I
will,’ Caroline promised. ‘We’re a Secret
Society just at present. That’s why we’re
all wearing red roses.’</p>

<p>‘I wish I could have joined it,’ said the
Unusual Clergyman; ‘perhaps you’ll let me
join later?’</p>

<p>‘If I ever can, I will,’ said Caroline
cordially. And then the others came to look
at the newt, and they all went home in the
carriage to tea. The Uncle and the Unusual
Clergyman talked about things which the
children did not understand, or perhaps they
might have understood if they had listened,
but their thoughts were in tumblers full of
beef and pudding behind the books on the
shelves, and though they caught a few words,
‘golden bough,’ ‘myths,’ ‘folk-lore,’ they did
not pay much attention till they heard the
words ‘secret rites’ and ‘symbolic,’ and then
the Uncle suddenly said:</p>

<p>‘Well, come along to my room, won’t
you? I’ll show you that passage I wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>s
speaking of.’ And he and the clergyman
went off.</p>

<p>Of course the three C.’s hastened to the
stable-yard. The men had gone to their tea
and the servants were having theirs, so it was
quite safe. The tumblers of food, now thinly
iced with congealed fat and looking very
uninviting, were carried in the side-pockets
of Charles and under the pinafores of the
girls.</p>

<p>William received the visitors with marked
disapproval.</p>

<p>‘You’re late,’ he said. ‘I’ve got to go
down to the village to see about a new axle
for the light cart. What’s all that rubbish?
Ain’t what I gives him good enough for his
lordship?’ He looked sourly at the tumblers
the children had stood upon the corn-bin.</p>

<p>‘Of course it is,’ said Caroline, feeling that
a fatal error had been committed. ‘We only
thought he’d like a change. Don’t be cross,
William. You know you’re our beanyfactor.’</p>

<p>‘Well, beany or no beany, you don’t see
’im to-night. Off with you. I’ll see ’e’s all
right. Yes, you can leave the grub. You
come ’bout eight in the morning if you can,
and then we’ll see.’</p>

<p>It was a disappointed party that returned
to the dining-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I did think it would be different,’ said
Charlotte. ‘It’s all so dull. And it’ll go on
being like this for weeks.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the dreadful anxiousness <i>I</i> don’t like,’
said Caroline. ‘The clergyman said secrets
were awkward pets to keep, and they are.’</p>

<p>‘Why is everything always different from
what it was when you thought it was always
going to be the same?’ Charlotte asked, with
the air of an inquiring philosopher.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ said Caroline, ‘we are rather
young for rescues.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but,’ Charles urged, ‘we couldn’t do
anything <i>except</i> rescue. We can’t do anything
else <i>now</i>, however young we are.’</p>

<p>They talked about it for an hour, and said
the same things over and over, and then Mr.
Penfold came in to say good-bye.</p>

<p>‘I’m translating that book. I’m getting
on with it,’ he said; ‘it’s most interesting.
I’ve got some of the manuscript in my pocket.’</p>

<p>‘Oh do let us look!’ they all said at
once.</p>

<p>‘Well, just one page then, only one, or I
shall be late for the choir practice.’</p>

<p>He laid down a type-written page and they
all sprawled over the table to read it.</p>

<p>‘To obtain your suit,’ it said. ‘Herbs
favourable to the granting of petitions....’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
There was a blank for the names of the herbs,
which Mr. Penfold hadn’t yet had time, he told
them, to translate.</p>

<p>‘Suitors to kings and those in high places
shall note well these herbs,’ the translation
went on, ‘and offer the flowers and leaves in
bunches or garlands when they go to tender
their suit. More efficacious it is, however,
if the herbs be bruised and their juices expressed,
and a decoction given to drink in a
little warm sack or strong waters or any liquor
convenient. But for this ye need interest
with the household of the king or him who
has the granting of the desire. These herbs
have the virtue to incline the heart favourably
towards suitors if gathered in the first quarter
of Luna by the hand of the petitioner in his
proper person.’</p>

<p>That was the end of the page. The
children had to own that they couldn’t understand
it.</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said the Unusual One, ‘it only
means if you’re going to ask a favour of any
one. One of the herbs was balsam, I believe.
Now I must fly. Keep the page till to-morrow
if you like.’</p>

<p>They did like. And when he was gone
Charlotte spoke.</p>

<p>‘Look here. We shall have to tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Uncle. Let’s decoct him some balsam and
then tell him.’</p>

<p>But the others wouldn’t hear of it. They
had to hear of it, however, next day, when at
twelve o’clock William allowed them to visit
Rupert in his loft. Rupert’s eyes were very
bright and his hands were very hot, and he
coughed almost all the time—a very little cough,
but most persevering.</p>

<p>‘William,’ Caroline came down the ladder
to say, ‘we must tell uncle. I’m sure
Rupert’s ill. He ought to have a doctor.’</p>

<p>‘You’re right, Miss,’ William replied,
‘What did I tell you from the first?’</p>

<p>Caroline expected stern opposition from
Rupert, and even feared that he might say
that rather than have his secret given to an
uncle he would indeed run away to sea. But
he only turned his head restlessly on the straw
and said, ‘Oh, I don’t care! Do what you
like.’</p>

<p>The day was, most fortunately, fine. So
after dinner they all went into the garden to
get the balsam. But they couldn’t find any
balsam.</p>

<p>‘I’ll get the <i>Language Of</i>,’ said Caroline,
‘and we’ll take the herbs that seem most likely
to make a person do what you want.’</p>

<p>In finding suitable ‘herbs,’ first in the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
and then in the garden, the time went quickly:
there was a good deal of talk, of course.</p>

<p>‘I <i>really</i> don’t think we need worry,’ said
Caroline again and again. ‘I think with the
herbs it’s sure to be all right, and the Uncle
will let us keep him.’ She spoke as if Rupert
were a stray kitten or an ownerless puppy.
‘You see the fern-seed came right, and the
sorry bouquet we gave to the Wilmington
came right, and you’ll see this will. We’ll
give him some in his tea as well as the
bouquet, and that’ll make quite certain.’</p>

<p>‘It’s all nonsense,’ said Charlotte. ‘Besides,
he’ll spit it out. I know I should. You
can lead an uncle to the teapot but you can’t
make him drink.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll have calceolaria,’ Caroline finally
decided, ‘because it means “I offer you
pecuniary aid,” or “I offer you my fortune”;
and, of course, Rupert’ll cost something to
keep. And double china aster, if we can
find it, because it means “I share your sentiments.”
Straw means agreement, so we’ll
have that too. It needn’t show in the bouquet.
And eschscholtzia, because that signifies “do
not refuse me.”’</p>

<p>They got the calceolarias and the eschscholtzias,
but the gardener said the asters
weren’t out yet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s only two flowers,’ said Charlotte;
‘suppose we wear something in our button-holes
to mean “we trust in you”?’</p>

<p>Nothing meaning just that, however, could
be found in the book. The nearest was
heliotrope, ‘I turn to thee,’ and rhododendron,
‘danger.’ A bouquet of rhododendron and
heliotrope was, however, found to be incompatible
with the human button-hole, so these
flowers were added to the Uncle’s bouquet.</p>

<p>‘And now,’ said Charlotte, ‘let’s go in and
express the juices. We can’t chew them this
time, because it would be disgusting.’</p>

<p>‘Scissors and tea, <i>I</i> think,’ Charles said, and
this bright suggestion was acted on.</p>

<p>The Unusual Clergyman was perhaps partly
to blame for what followed. Calceolaria,
rhododendron, and eschscholtzia (a word I
spell with the greatest pain and difficulty)
were cut up very fine indeed with Caroline’s
nail-scissors, and secreted in Charles’s handkerchief—a
clean one fetched down for the
purpose. When the tea-tray was brought in,
and the maid had gone to ring the bell which
summons uncles, the lid of the teapot was
hurriedly raised and a good handful of chopped
leaves and petals thrust in.</p>

<p>The magic bouquet was placed on the
Uncle’s plate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>He came in, pale and shadowy as ever, and
yet looking, the children thought, somewhat
different, and took up the bouquet. It was
rather an odd one. The eschscholtzias were
drooping miserably among the strong rhododendrons;
so was the heliotrope. And the
calceolarias seemed shrivelled and unhappy;
and the straw, of which in his enthusiasm
Charles had brought a large double handful,
showed much more than Caroline had meant
it to.</p>

<p>‘What’s all this, eh?’ the Uncle asked.</p>

<p>‘It’s a sym-what’s-its-name bouquet.’</p>

<p>‘Simple?’ asked the Uncle; ‘it’s anything
but that. Sympathetic?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Charlotte, ‘sym- —what Mr.
Penfold was saying to you yesterday about
magic.’</p>

<p>‘Symbolic. I see. And what does it
symbolise?’ he asked kindly, but without
smiling.</p>

<p>‘We’ll tell you when you’ve had your tea,’
they all agreed in saying.</p>

<p>The Uncle sniffed the bouquet, and that was
perhaps why he did not sniff the tea. They
wondered how he could possibly not smell it,
for as Caroline poured it out it seemed to fill
the room with its strange mixed scent. However,
he just stirred it and talked about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a><br /><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a><br /><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
weather, not at all amusingly, and presently
he lifted the cup to his lips.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;">
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="375" height="602" alt="Uncle leaving table" />
<div class="caption">He screwed up his nose.</div>
</div>

<p>Six anxious eyes followed his every movement;
and his movements from the moment
the tea entered his mouth were brisk and
unusual. He screwed up his nose in a way
that at any less important moment would have
been funny, went quickly to the window, leaned
out, and did exactly what Charlotte had said
he would do.</p>

<p>‘Excuse me,’ he said, coming back to the
table and taking up the cup; ‘I beg your
pardon for that natural if impolite action. I
think this tea must be poisoned. Don’t drink
any of it, and please ring the bell. I must
inquire into this.’</p>

<p>Nobody moved.</p>

<p>‘We aren’t going to drink any,’ said
Charles.</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t inquire!’ said Charlotte
anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Was it <i>very</i> horrid?’ asked Caroline. ‘I
<i>am</i> so sorry.’</p>

<p>‘Will you kindly ring?’ the Uncle asked
coldly. It was a terrible moment, but
Caroline met it bravely.</p>

<p>‘No,’ she said; ‘don’t ask the servants,
please, uncle; it’s not their fault. <i>We</i> put the
stuff in the teapot.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You put poison in the teapot? For me?’
The Uncle suddenly sat down.</p>

<p>‘No, no, dear uncle,’ cried Caroline; ‘<i>not</i>
poison. Only calceolaria and eschscholtzia
and straw and rhododendron; it isn’t poison.
It’s just a little magic spell to make you say
“Yes” to what we want.’</p>

<p>‘Have I given you reason to suppose that I
could not grant your requirements without
spells?’ he asked severely.</p>

<p>‘Oh no! But we wanted to make sure.’</p>

<p>Charlotte held out the translation and the
Uncle read it.</p>

<p>‘But this doesn’t say calceolaria and all the
rest of it,’ he objected.</p>

<p>‘No, it doesn’t say. That’s just it. So we
had to get the nearest things we could. Straw
for agreement, because we want you to agree
to what we want; and calceolaria, because it
means “I offer you pecuniary aid”; and rhododendron
to show it’s dangerous not to; and es-what’s-its-name
for “do not refuse me.”’</p>

<p>‘Do not refuse you <i>what?</i>’ said the Uncle in
an exasperated voice.</p>

<p>The three of them looked at each other and
two of them said, ‘You tell, Caro.’</p>

<p>Caroline clasped her hands very tight, and
drew a long breath, and said very fast indeed:</p>

<p>‘There was a boy ran away from school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
called Rupert his master was cruel to him and
he came here and we hid him and put the
Police off the scent and he’s such a nice boy
and his father’s in India like ours and he’s in
the straw-loft now with such a dreadful cold
and I know the doctor ought to be sent for and
if you give him back to that Murdstone man I
know he’ll die and I can’t bear it and I’m very
very sorry it was silly putting the stuff in your
tea but we weren’t taking any chances and if
you’re angry about the tea do punish us but
stick to Rupert and oh uncle I don’t know
what to say but what would you have done if
you’d been us?’</p>

<p>‘There, there,’ said the Uncle gently, and
not seeming as surprised as they expected;
‘don’t cry. Don’t <i>you</i> begin,’ he added with
more sternness to Charles, who was becoming
subject to sniffs. ‘There, go and wash your
faces. We’ll have some fresh tea made in
another pot, and talk it over.’</p>

<p>‘It’s hopeful, I tell you,’ said Caroline, washing
her face; ‘he’s not said “No.” Oh, I
believe the spell’s working. Stop snivelling,
Charlotte. There’s nothing to cry about, <i>yet</i>.’</p>

<p>‘You began,’ said Charlotte truthfully.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t,’ said Caroline; ‘and if I did, you
put it all on to me, and I didn’t know what I
was saying or doing. Come on down. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
mustn’t let him think it over by himself too
long.’</p>

<p>Over tea, for which nobody felt very hungry,
the Uncle asked many questions, and heard
the full story of the escape and the Royal
Order of the Secret Rose.</p>

<p>‘And don’t blame William, will you?’
Charlotte begged; ‘because he’s done nothing
but say tell you ever since it began.’</p>

<p>‘I shall not blame William,’ said the Uncle.</p>

<p>‘I wanted to tell you,’ said Caroline; ‘at
least next day I did, but it wasn’t my secret.
And Rupert agreed for us to tell now.’</p>

<p>Tea was over and there was a silence.
Uncle Charles was looking from one to another
of the children.</p>

<p>‘And you really believed,’ he said slowly,
‘that putting that abominable stuff in my tea
would make me agree to keep your runaway
boy?’</p>

<p>‘There was the fern-seed, you know,’ said
Charlotte; ‘and it said in the book that the
decoction of balsam would make you grant our
desire, and calceolaria’s as good as balsam any
day.’</p>

<p>‘And you really thought it would?’</p>

<p>‘Won’t it?’ asked Caroline, and her eyes
filled with tears. ‘Oh, uncle, if you only knew
how I hated giving you that horrid stuff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
instead of your nice tea. It hurt me far more
than it did you.’</p>

<p>The Uncle laughed faintly, but he did
laugh.</p>

<p>‘Then you <i>will</i> grant our desire,’ cried
Charlotte. ‘You couldn’t laugh if you weren’t
going to. So you see the herbs did do the
magic.’</p>

<p>‘Something seems to have done it,’ said the
Uncle. ‘You had better give me a red rose
and two buds and enrol me as a member of
your Royal Order of the Secret Rose.’ He
found himself suddenly involved in a violent
threefold embrace.</p>

<p>‘I will give you a word of advice,’ he said,
settling his neck-tie when it was over. ‘Never
try to administer philtres or potions <i>inwardly</i>.
Outward application is quite as efficacious.
Indeed I am not sure but what your bouquet
was in itself enough to work the spell. Something
has certainly worked it. For I may
now tell you that Mrs. Wilmington had her
suspicions, and by a stratagem surprised the
secret this afternoon. She told me and wished
to send for the Police. But I heard William’s
story, and decided not to send for the Police
till after tea. But now Mrs. Wilmington has
seen the boy, you may as well make her a
Royal Rose too. She will not betray you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>The children looked at each other amazed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington? It was unbelievable.</p>

<p>‘The doctor is coming at once,’ said the
Uncle. ‘I hope it isn’t measles.’</p>

<p>‘Then, if we hadn’t spelled you, should you
have given him up to the Police?’ Caroline
asked.</p>

<p>‘Your telling me, or the spell, or something
has stopped that. Now run away and play in
the park. If the illness is not infectious you
shall see your little friend later.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, uncle,’ said Charlotte in heartfelt
tones, ‘it’s a long lane that never rejoices.
We have been so sick about it. And now
it’s all right. And you <i>are</i> a dear.’</p>

<p>‘The dearest dear,’ corrected Caroline.</p>

<p>‘I call him a brick,’ said Charles, with the
air of a man of the world.</p>

<p>‘There’s only one thing more,’ said the
Uncle; ‘go and get me that red rose, and
then I shall know that you’ll let me into the
next really important secret you have.’</p>

<p>They ran to get it, and the Uncle took it
and the petition bouquet away with him to his
study.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When the doctor had paid his visit they
were allowed to see Rupert for a few minutes
before bedtime—not in the straw-loft as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
had expected, but in the blue room, which is
hung with tapestry, and has blue silk curtains
to windows and four-poster.</p>

<p>‘They brought me in at tea-time,’ Rupert
told them. ‘That Mrs. Wilmington of yours
is first-class. I don’t know what you meant by
saying she was a rotter. And your uncle—isn’t
he a brick?’</p>

<p>Charles was glad he had thought of that
word himself, Rupert’s using it showed it was
the correct thing to say.</p>

<p>‘I’m jolly glad you told him,’ Rupert went
on. ‘Of course we couldn’t have gone on the
other way. And he’s sent a telegram a mile
long to my people in India to ask whether I
mayn’t stay on here till school begins again.’</p>

<p>‘How splendid,’ said Charlotte, awe-struck;
‘how awfully splendid! I didn’t think uncles
<i>could</i> be like that.’</p>

<p>‘Uncles are all right,’ said Rupert, ‘if you
treat them properly.’</p>

<p>Then he began to cough, and Mrs. Wilmington
came in with lemonade and honey, and told
the others that they were tiring him, and it was
bedtime anyhow.</p>

<p>‘If you treat them properly,’ said Charlotte
dreamily, as she brushed her hair, ‘uncles are
all right. Do you think <i>he</i> would have been all
right if we hadn’t treated him just as we did?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No,’ said Caroline. ‘Just unhook me, will
you, Char? I don’t. I think it was the spell.’</p>

<p>‘So do I,’ said Charlotte. ‘Stand still or I
can’t unhook you. What the eye doesn’t see,
the hook doesn’t come out of. I expect the
tea was like what Miss Peckitt’s sister’s mistress
had when their house was burglared—nervous
shock. I expect that is the same as electric
shocks making people walk that couldn’t before.
I expect the nervous shock made that part of
uncle that grants favours wake up and walk,
don’t you?’</p>

<p>‘You make haste into bed,’ said Caroline.
‘What’s the good of talking all round it? We
did what it said in the book, and it happened
like it said in the book it would happen. I
believe you could manage everything with
spells if you only knew the proper ones.
When I grow up I shall be a professoress
of magic spells and have my business office
in a beautiful palace, and kings and queens
will come in their golden chariots to ask me
what spells they ought to do to make their
subjects happy and not poor, and for everybody
to have a chicken in the pot, and——’</p>

<p>‘Talk about talking!’ said Charlotte. ‘Come
along to bed; do.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE ROSICURIANS</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> door of the drawing-room at the Manor
House was kept locked, and Mrs. Wilmington
dusted the room herself and carried its key in
her pocket. After the Uncle had said that
about Mrs. Wilmington having expected the
children to break everything in the house,
the three C.’s began to wonder whether the
drawing-room had always been kept in this
locked-up state, or whether it was only done
on their account.</p>

<p>‘Out of compliment to us,’ as Charles
put it.</p>

<p>‘I almost think it must be that,’ Caroline
said; ‘because of course drawing-rooms are for
people to sit in, and the Wilmington must
expect some one to sit in it or she wouldn’t dust
it so carefully.’</p>

<p>‘I looked in the other day when she was
dusting,’ said Charlotte. ‘I couldn’t see much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
just a bit of the carpet, pink and grey and
pretty, and the corner of a black cupboard-thing
with trees and birds and gold Chinamen
on it, and a table with a soup tureen with red
rabbits’ heads for handles, and a round looking-glass
that you could see some more of the
room in, all tiny and all drawn wrong somehow—you
know the sort; convict mirrors,
Harriet says they are. I asked her.’</p>

<p>‘When?’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know. Just after. And
Harriet goes in to sweep it. She says its
full of lovelies.’</p>

<p>‘Why don’t you ask her if it was shut up
out of compliment to us?’ Charles asked.</p>

<p>‘Because I wasn’t going to put ideas into
Harriet’s head, of course.’</p>

<p>And Caroline agreed that such a question
would have been simply giving themselves
away.</p>

<p>Each of the three C.’s had turned the handle
of the drawing-room door many times to see
whether by chance Mrs. Wilmington had just
this once not remembered to lock it. But
she always had. And their interest in the
room had steadily grown. And now here
was another wet day, just the day for examining
golden Chinamen and looking at yourself
in convex mirrors; and the room wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>s
locked up so that no one could enjoy these
advantages.</p>

<p>Rupert was still in bed, the doctor had
decided against measles; but the feverish cold
which had given rise to the measle idea was
still too bad for Rupert to be anywhere but
where he was. And the others were only
allowed to see him for a few minutes at a time.
Mrs. Wilmington had, so Harriet explained,
‘taken to the new young gentleman in a way
you’d hardly believe,’ and was spending the
afternoon reading <i>Masterman Ready</i> to him
after a baffled attempt to read him <i>Eric, or
Little by Little</i>, which she fetched from her
own room on purpose, and which Rupert
stopped his ears with his fingers rather than
listen to.</p>

<p>‘It is <i>the</i> time,’ said Charlotte; ‘there is a
time in the affairs of men that they call the
Nick. And this is it. Let’s try to get in.
The Wilmington is safely out of the way.
Let’s!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, let’s,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘No, don’t let’s,’ said Caroline. ‘The
Uncle mightn’t want us to. Perhaps compliments
to us aren’t the real reason. Perhaps
there’s some wonderful secret kept in there,
known only to the head of the house and his
faithful Wilmington. The Uncle’s been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
jolly decent. Let’s ask the Wilmington for
the key.’</p>

<p>The others laughed, and Charles said, ‘You
know well enough <i>that’s</i> no earthly.’</p>

<p>Caroline did not think there could be a
secret, because the Uncle was now a member
of the Royal Order of the Secret Rose, whose
unchangeable motto was ‘halves in all secrets.’</p>

<p>‘So if there’d been anything like <i>that</i> he’d
have told us without preservation,’ Charles
added. ‘Yes, I agree with Caro.’</p>

<p>‘And,’ said Charlotte, ‘I don’t see—— Oh,
I say, I’ve got an idea! Let’s have
another hunt for that second book the Lady
in the picture’s got under her elbow. We
really ought to find it. It’s a sacred duty
we owe the Uncle for being so decent about
Rupert.’</p>

<p>‘The drawing-room door’s knob is just the
same as this one’s,’ Charles pointed out;
‘and the morning-room’s and the library’s
door knobs are the same too. Let’s see if
this key won’t fit the drawing-room.’ He
rattled the key of the dining-room door as he
spoke.</p>

<p>‘I wish you wouldn’t,’ said Caroline. ‘It’s
jolly rough on me. Everybody always blames
the eldest. I wish you’d been the eldest,
Charles.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I would have if I could, you bet,’ said
Charles. ‘Come on.’</p>

<p>‘No, look here,’ said Caroline desperately,
‘please don’t. And I’ll go and ask uncle if
we mayn’t. There!’</p>

<p>‘But we’re forbidden to disturb him.’</p>

<p>‘I’d rather disturb him than go poking into
places he doesn’t want us to go poking into.
Don’t you see? If he doesn’t mind us going
in he’ll say “Yes,” and if he does mind he’ll
say “No,” and then we shall be glad we didn’t
without asking him.’</p>

<p>‘But what could be in there that he doesn’t
want us to see?’ Charles wanted to know.</p>

<p>‘Oh, anything! Clouds of live butterflies
that are let out after lunch, and go back to
their cages when the tea-bell rings. I think
Caro’s right about asking the Uncle,’ Charlotte
said.</p>

<p>‘Butterflies are simply piffle,’ Charles
pointed out. ‘They’d be laying their eggs all
over everything and turning into cocoons all
the time. I know, because of silkworms.’</p>

<p>‘Well, a snake then,’ said Charlotte briskly:
‘an enormous king-serpent, with a crown on its
head, and yards and yards long, that comes out
of a cupboard from two to four every day, and
twines pieces of itself round the legs of the
furniture, or your legs if you go in. It wouldn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
mind what legs they were it twined round, I
expect.’</p>

<p>‘I like snakes,’ said Charles briefly. ‘Let
Caro go to the Uncle if she wants to.’</p>

<p>They all went. It was deemed respectful
to wash a little.</p>

<p>‘They like you to be clean when you ask
for things,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘It’s always “wash!” whatever you do,’
Charlotte complained. ‘While there’s life
there’s soap.’ But she washed too.</p>

<p>There was an agitated pause on the sheepskin
mat outside the Uncle’s study door.</p>

<p>‘Shall we knock?’ Charles asked.</p>

<p>‘You don’t knock at sitting-room doors,’
said Caroline, turned the handle, and opened
the door three inches and three-eighths.</p>

<p>‘Who’s that?’ said the voice of the Uncle.
‘How often am I to give orders that I am not
to be disturbed on any pretence?’</p>

<p>‘There isn’t any pretence,’ Charles was
beginning, when Caroline broke in with:</p>

<p>‘It’s a depredation of the Secret Rose.’</p>

<p>‘So I perceive. But I am too busy to play
now,’ said the Uncle; and you could tell by
the very way he spoke that he had his thumb
in a book and was afraid of losing his place.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t play. We want to ask your permission
for something.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, if I receive this deputation, will it
undertake not to do it again for a week, on
any pretence? Then come in.’</p>

<p>They came in, to a room that seemed quite
full of books. There were books on the tables,
books on the floor, books on the mantelpiece
and on the window-ledge, books open and
books shut, books old and new, books handsome
and ugly. The Uncle seemed even to have
used books to cover the walls with, as ordinary
people use wall-paper. He was sitting at a
wide green leather-covered writing-table, and
sure enough he had his thumb in a tall brown
folio.</p>

<p>They all said ‘Good morning’ politely, and
Caroline coughed and said:</p>

<p>‘If you please, uncle, we want to explore
the whole house to look for the other book—the
book, I mean, that is lost out of the picture.
Dame Eleanour’s book, I mean. You said we
might. But the drawing-room door’s locked.’</p>

<p>‘Dear me,’ said the Uncle impatiently,
‘can’t you unlock it.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ Charles told him. ‘The Wil—I
mean Mrs. Wilmington keeps the key in her
under-pocket.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, she does, does she? You won’t break
anything? But of course you won’t,’ said the
Uncle rather in a hurry. ‘Well, as member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>s
of the Society of the Secret Rose, I’ll let you
through my secret door.’</p>

<p>He put a folded paper in his book to mark
the place, got up, and crossed the room to a
low narrow door by the fireplace that looked
as though it led to a cupboard. He went
through the door and the children followed
him. They found themselves in a little
carpeted corridor. At the left was a door,
closed and barred; to the right a flight of
stairs, and in front another door. This the
Uncle opened.</p>

<p>‘Here is the drawing-room,’ he said; and
there it was. They could see a corner of its
carpet, and it was the same pink and grey
rose-pattern as the other corner that Charlotte
had seen.</p>

<p>‘Now come up here,’ said the Uncle, and
led the way. At the top of the stairs was
another door. The Uncle opened it, and
behold, the well-known corridor, with the
stuffed birds and fishes, from which their bedroom
doors opened.</p>

<p>‘I will give you the key of this door to
keep,’ said the Uncle, ‘and then you can visit
the drawing-room when you please. If you do
not disturb anything, and refrain from making
your visits in muddy boots, Mrs. Wilmington
need never know. It will be a secret between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
us—my little contribution to the Society of
the Rose. Like a conspiracy, isn’t it?’ he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Just exactly like,’ every one agreed, and
asked whether it was really a secret staircase.</p>

<p>‘It is now, at any rate,’ said the Uncle. ‘It
used to be merely the humble backstairs, but
I had it shut up because I dislike noise.’</p>

<p>‘We’ll always come down in our bath
slippers,’ Caroline promised him. ‘Oh, uncle,
you are a darling!’</p>

<p>The Uncle submitted to a complicated threefold
embrace, and went back to his brown
folio.</p>

<p>‘Now, then,’ said the three, and entered the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>You went up three steps to it. That was
why you could not reach up from the outside
to look through the windows, of which there
were three. They were curtained with grey
and pink brocade that rhymed with the carpet.
There were tall gold-framed mirrors set over
marble console tables with golden legs, and
round mirrors whose frames had round knobs
on them, and oval mirrors with candlesticks
branching out from underneath them. There
was a golden harp with hardly any of its strings
broken, in one corner, and a piano with inlaid
woods of varied colours, on which Caroline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
would have dearly loved to play ‘The Bluebells
of Scotland’ and Haydn’s ‘Surprise’; but,
as this would have meant Mrs. Wilmington’s
surprise too, it was not to be thought of.
There were carved Indian cabinets with
elephants and lions on them, and Chinese
cabinets with mandarins and little-footed gold
ladies, and pagodas in ivory under glass cases,
and wax flowers also glass-cased. There were
statues, tall and white and cold, and boxes of
carved ivory and carved ebony, and one of
porcupine quills, and one of mother-of-pearl and
silver—a work-box that was. There were
cushions and chair-seats of faded needlework;
old and beautiful and straight-backed chairs
and round-backed chairs; two crystal chandeliers
that looked like fountains wrong way
up; china of all sorts, including a Chinaman
who wagged his head when you came near
him.</p>

<p>In fact, the room was the kind of room you
sometimes find in houses where the same
family has lived for many many many years,
and each generation has taken care of the
beautiful things left by its ancestors, and has
added one or two more beautiful things, to be
taken care of by the generation that is to come
after. You could have amused yourself there
for an hour just by looking; and the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
C.’s remembered joyously that they had not
been forbidden to touch.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how careful children can be
if they do not allow their minds to wander
from their determination to be careful. The
three C.’s looked at everything and touched a
good many things, and did not break or hurt
anything at all. They examined the cabinets,
opening their doors and pulling out every
drawer in the hope of discovering some secret
place where The Book might be. But they
only found coins and medals and chessmen
and draughts and spellicans, bright foreign
sea-shells, a sea-horse and a snake skin, some
mother-of-pearl counters and ivory draughts,
and an ivory cribbage board inlaid with brass
that shone like gold.</p>

<p>‘It’s no good,’ said Charles at last, pulling
out one of the lacquered drawers; ‘let’s play
spellicans. It’s a nice quiet game that grown-ups
like you to play, and we owe the Uncle
<i>something</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s have just <i>one</i> more look,’ Charlotte
pleaded. ‘Oh, I say, we haven’t looked at
the books yet.’</p>

<p>There were books, not many, on some of
the tables—large books with pictures, and one,
a photograph book, so heavy that Caroline
could not lift it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I say. Look here,’ she called out; ‘this
book’s only got about three pages of uncles
and aunts, the rest is solid, like a box made to
imitate a book. Suppose <i>the</i> book were inside
the box part?’</p>

<p>‘Won’t it open?’ The others were crowding
close to look.</p>

<p>‘There’s a sort of catch there,’ said Charles,
putting his finger on a little brass button.</p>

<p>‘Oh, crikey!’ he started back. So did the
others. For a low whirring sound had come
from the book, and Charlotte had hardly time
to say, ‘It’s a Nihilist bomb, come away!’
before the book broke into the silvery chiming
cadence of ‘Home, Sweet Home.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a musical box,’ Charlotte explained
needlessly. And then the same thought struck
each mind.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Wilmington!’ For the musical box
was a fine one, and its clear silvery notes rang
out through the room. Mrs. Wilmington must
hear wherever she was. She would hear and
come.</p>

<p>‘Fly!’ said Caroline, and they fled. They
got out, locked the door, rushed softly yet
swiftly up the stairs and waited behind the
upper door till they heard Mrs. Wilmington’s
alpaca sweep down the front stairs. Then
out, and down after her, quickly and quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a><br /><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a><br /><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
so that when, having found the musical box
playing with sweet tinkling self-possession to
an empty drawing-room whose doors were
locked, and having satisfied herself that no
intruder lurked behind brocaded curtain or
Indian screen, she came to the dining-room,
she found the three C.’s quietly seated there
each with a book, a picture of good little
children on a rainy day. She could not see
that Charles’s book was a <i>Bradshaw</i> and
Caroline’s <i>Zotti’s Italian Grammar</i>, wrong
way up.</p>

<div class="caption">‘It’s a Nihilist bomb, come away!‘</div>
</div>

<p>‘Oh, you <i>are</i> here,’ she said; ‘did you hear
that musical box?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the children meekly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington stood a moment in the
door. She did not understand machinery, and
to her it seemed quite possible that a musical
box might begin to play all on its own account
without any help from outside. On the other
hand, it had never chosen to do it before these
children came.</p>

<p>‘You ought not to wear bedroom slippers
in the sitting-rooms,’ she said, and went away
without more words.</p>

<p>‘I nearly burst,’ said Charles then; ‘especially
when she noticed our feet.’</p>

<p>‘But she’ll find out,’ Charlotte said. ‘She
found out about Rupert. Let’s go back <i>now;</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
because she won’t think we’re <i>there</i> now she
knows we’re <i>here</i>. There was another book,
all heavy too. We’ll start that and wake her
up again.’</p>

<p>‘I say, isn’t it a lark?’ Charles whispered,
as they crept up the stairs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>THE OTHER BOOK</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">They</span> found the second book. It was not
so heavy as the other, but in it, too, there
were only three or four pages of ladies in
crinolines and gentlemen in whiskers and
chokers, leaning against marble pillars with
velvet curtains loosely draped in the background.</p>

<p>‘Be careful,’ Charlotte urged; ‘be quite
ready to fly before you start it.’</p>

<p>But when they pressed the little catch and
sprang towards the door ready to ‘fly,’ no
silvery sound met the ear. In an awe-struck
silence they went slowly back to the table.</p>

<p>And now, looking more closely, they saw
that the catch was not made to press down
but to slide along. Charlotte pushed it. A
lid flew up, and there was a space that had
perhaps once held a musical box, but now held
a reel of silk, an old velvet needle-book with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
a view of the Isle of Wight painted on it
outside, and inside, needles red with many a
year’s rust; a box of beads with a glass top, a
bone silk-winder, a netting needle, and a sheet
of paper with some finely pencilled writing on
it.</p>

<p>‘Bother!’ said Charles; ‘let’s start the
other.’</p>

<p>But Charlotte was looking at the beads and
Caroline was looking at the writing.</p>

<p>‘What jolly little different beads, not a bit
like now,’ said Charlotte; and Caroline said:</p>

<p>‘It’s a list of books, that’s all. I say,’ she
added in quite another voice, ‘that Thessalonian
book is underlined, <i>hard</i>, I wonder
why?’ She unfolded the paper and turned it
over. ‘There’s another underlined, Pope’s
Ill Something,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘<i>Iliad</i>,’ said Charles, looking over her
shoulder. ‘I always know Latin words the
minute I see them, even if I don’t know what
they mean. Let’s start the other musical box.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Caroline quickly, ‘let’s find Pope’s
What’s-its-name. There’s only those two underlined.
It’s a clue, that’s what it is. Come on
and don’t make a row. I feel we’re on the
brink of—the very brink. Punctuality and
despatch.’</p>

<p>‘All the books in the dining-room’s name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>s
are in a book at the end of the bottom shelf,’
said Charles. ‘I know, because I thought it
was <i>the</i> book; the cover’s something like the
one in the picture.’</p>

<p>It was easy to find Pope’s <i>Iliad</i> in the
Catalogue. ‘1 vol. Top shelf. Case 6.
Number 39,’ it said. Then there was a rush
for Case 6 and a dragging of chairs to the spot.
Caroline being the tallest, reached the volume
and got it down.</p>

<p>‘The cover feels loose in my hand,’ she said.
‘Oh, I do believe it is!’</p>

<p>It was. From the loose boards whose back
pretended that they were covering Mr.
Alexander Pope’s translation of the Greek epic,
another and quite different book came forth.
A thin brown book, the second book of the
picture! Charlotte climbed on a chair expressly
to compare the two. There was no doubt of it.
The two were the same. Inside was yellowy
paper with a queer sort of waviness about it,
and large print of that curious old-fashioned
kind where the s’s are all like f’s, except at the
ends of words.</p>

<p>‘We can read this,’ said Charles hopefully.
‘I mean even <i>you</i> can. It’s not Latin
this time. Let’s take it to uncle and tell
him we’ve found it. <i>Won’t</i> he be delighted
with us?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We promised not to bother for a week,’
Charlotte reminded him. ‘Let’s keep it for a
week, and then we’ll give him the two together.
He won’t be able to believe his eyes. It <i>is</i> an
eyesore, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘I think what you mean’s a sight for sore
eyes,’ Caroline suggested. ‘Let’s have a look.
Is it spells?’</p>

<p>‘It looks like all about being ill,’ said
Charlotte doubtfully; ‘but it’s very hard with
these s’s pretending to be f’s, and the spelling
is rum, isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘All spelling’s rum, I think,’ said Charles;
‘especially ie’s and ei’s.’</p>

<p>‘I.E., except after C,’ said Charlotte absently,
‘It says, “Government and Virtues. It is
under the Moon!”’</p>

<p>‘What is?’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> don’t know. It goes on: “It is a good
wound-e herb-e and the juice taken in wine
helpeth the jaundice, and is ſovereign for the
plague, if ſo be the ſufferer be not too far gone
in it.”’</p>

<p>‘What does? What is?’</p>

<p>‘“The flowers,”’ Charlotte read on, ‘“be
large and yellow in forme and in others paler
and ſmaller. The ſtalk is two feet high and
divideth himſelf into many ſpreading branches.’”</p>

<p>‘What does?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Rugged wort. It’s all about plants, I think,
and what they’re good for.’</p>

<p>‘How glorious!’ Caroline cried and clapped
her hands. ‘Now we’ve got all three. The
spells, and the medicine, and the <i>Language
Of</i>. And what one won’t do, the other will.
Hist! not a word!’ She had only just time to
throw the book into a chair and sit down on it
as the door opened, and Harriet entered with
the tea-tray.</p>

<p>The Uncle did not come in to tea. Only
Mrs. Wilmington looked in for a moment to
say that Rupert’s cold was worse, and that they
had better not see him again that day.</p>

<p>‘And please don’t be up and down stairs all
the time in your heavy boots,’ she added.</p>

<p>‘Our feet don’t seem to please her to-day,
somehow, whatever we put them in,’ said
Charlotte. ‘I wish we could give her something
to make her like us. We might just as
well be black-beetles.’</p>

<p>‘What we’ve got to do,’ said Caroline,
pouring out milk, ‘is to get Rupert better. I
felt all the time in the drawing-room how hateful
it is for him to be out of things like this.
If we could work something out of the three
books, I’m sure he would get all right in no
time. A threefold spell; that’s what we
want.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Well, we can’t have it then,’ said Charlotte.
‘I should think <i>two</i> books would be ample.
It’s only a cold he’s got. It might want the
three if it was plague or wounds or jauntry—jaundice,
or whatever it is.’</p>

<p>They spread out the book on the table as
soon as tea was cleared away, and put their
heads together over the yellow pages. But
it was some time before they could find anything
that seemed as though it could possibly
do Rupert any good.</p>

<p>‘What a beastly lot of herbs there are in
the world,’ Charlotte remarked. And Charles
reminded her that they called any old flower
an herb in books.</p>

<p>‘What I can’t understand,’ he added, ‘is
how people can possibly have so many disgusting
things the matter with them—palsy
and leprosy and quinsy, and all the other
things as well.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose people have them now,’
said Caroline consolingly. ‘Aunt Emmeline
says Hygiene has got on so nicely, people don’t
have nearly such awful things the matter with
them as they used. Look at the Black Death
in fourteen hundred something. You never
hear of black deaths now.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder whether funerals are black because
of that,’ said Charles. ‘I think there’s something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in Latin about Black Death knocking
the back of the horseman with an even
foot.’</p>

<p>‘I always did think Latin was nonsense,’
said Charlotte.</p>

<p>Their eyes were quite tired of the yellow
paper and the long s’s before the great idea
occurred to them. It was Caroline who had it.</p>

<p>‘Let’s look up Roses,’ she said. ‘I’m sure
the rose is Rupert’s lucky flower. Perhaps
if we made a conserve, or a decoction, or
a tincture or something——’</p>

<p>‘We promised not to give any one anything
for their insides. I’ve just remembered,’ said
Charles. ‘How rotten!’</p>

<p>‘Never mind—let’s look! We’ll make it
a spell as well. Out of the <i>Language Of</i>. I
expect it’ll work all right. Find Rose.’</p>

<p>They found Rose—pages and pages of it.
The author of the <i>Herbal</i> had plenty to say.
As he himself put it: ‘If I ſhould ſet down here
all uſes of the roſe my booke would be already
too long.’</p>

<p>But after diligent search they found out that
the rose is under the dominion of Venus.</p>

<p>‘That’s all right,’ said Charles. ‘She had
a little boy of her own. So she’d know.’</p>

<p>Also, that the decoction of roses ‘is proper to
cool the heat of fevers.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Only we don’t know what fever Rupert’s
got,’ Charles said. ‘It might be the scarlet
kind or the swine kind, if humans have that.’</p>

<p>They also found that the rose was ‘a conſiderable
reſtorative. The bitterneſs of the
roſes when they be freſh is of good uſe to cure
choler and watery humours.’</p>

<p>‘I suppose watery humours means when
you’re in the humour to cry; he isn’t that,’ said
Charlotte.</p>

<p>Farther down the page they found: ‘The
moiſt conſerve of roſes mixed with mithridate
and taken together is good for thoſe that are
troubled with diſtillations of rheum from the
brain to the eyes and the noſe.’</p>

<p>‘That’s it!’ cried Caroline. ‘I knew the
rose would do the trick! I know a cold in the
head is rheum. That’s French. I daresay it’s
Latin too,’ she added hastily. ‘But I never
knew before that colds come from your brain.
I expect that’s what makes you feel so duffing
when you’ve got a cold.’</p>

<p>If a doubt was still left in any breast, it was
set at rest when they learned that ‘Red roſes
procure reſt and ſleep,’ and that ‘a ſtrong
tincture of the roſe maketh a pleaſant julep,
calmeth delirium, and helpeth the action of the
bark.’</p>

<p>‘Rest’s what he wants; the Wil-cat said so,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Caroline shut the book with a bang, ‘and if roses
help the action of the bark, that’s the very
thing. She said the cough wanted easing.’</p>

<p>‘Does bark mean cough?’ Charles asked
doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘You may depend it did in those old times,’
Caroline assured him. ‘Aunt Emmeline told
me lots of the words they call slang now, were
book-words once. “Swank” wasn’t slang in
Shakespeare’s time, she said. And it’s stopped
raining. Let’s get the roses, and we can
think about how we’ll give them afterwards.
Perhaps if he just smelt them.’</p>

<p>‘There was an old Roman Johnny,’ said
Charles instructively; ‘he asked all his friends
to a party, and let down tons of rose leaves on
them till they died. Couldn’t we do that to
Rupert? Not till he died, of course, but till
he got better.’</p>

<p>‘We might cover him with rose leaves,’ said
Caroline, delighted with the romantic idea,
‘like babes in the wood. Let’s get pillow-cases
full—I know where the linen-room is—and
hide them till every one’s in bed. And
then put them over him. We ought to put
something out of the <i>Language Of</i> as well.
Iceland moss means health, I believe. Only
there isn’t any.’</p>

<p>A hasty search in the <i>Language of Flowers</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
informed them that nemophila meant ‘success
everywhere’; and as nothing more suitable
could be found, it was decided to mix a few
nemophila flowers with the rose leaves.</p>

<p>‘There was a secret Society once called
The Rosicurians. Aunt Emmeline told me,’
said Caroline. ’<i>We</i> shall be that if the roses
cure Rupert. I like being long-ago things,
don’t you?’</p>

<p>The garden was very wet indeed. Even in
mackintoshes it was difficult to avoid getting
wet through. Every tree dripped on the
children’s heads, and the water from the
soaked rose leaves ran up their sleeves and
down their necks. There were so many fully-blown
roses that it was easy enough to fill the
three frilled linen pillow-cases, though of
course it isn’t the sort of thing that is done all
in a minute.</p>

<p>It was nearly bedtime when the three
dripping children, each carrying a dripping
sack of rose leaves, stood outside the arbour
which led to the secret passage. They had
gone out that way.</p>

<p>‘I know we were told not to,’ Charlotte had
said, ’but it was only the Wil-cat who told us,
and it was only because the Uncle doesn’t like
other people to use the passage. And of course
we’ll tell him afterwards, and he’ll say it was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
right. When we’ve cured Rupert every one
will say how clever.’</p>

<p>Yet now at the last they hesitated.</p>

<p>‘I do wish I could remember,’ said Caroline
frowning, ’whether we <i>did</i> promise not to go
through the passage or whether it was only
that we were <i>told</i> not to. It really does make
<i>all</i> the difference, doesn’t it?’</p>

<p>(It often happens that grown-up people think
children are disobedient because really and truly
the children <i>can’t</i> remember whether they
promised or not, and naturally they give themselves
the benefit of the doubt. Sometimes
the grown-ups do not, in their turn, give the
children this benefit.)</p>

<p>Neither Charles nor Charlotte could remember
having promised.</p>

<p>‘Then here goes!’ said Caroline, pushing
open the door. The candle they had put there
in readiness gave them enough light to fasten
the bolts by, and also to find the recess in the
vault of the passage which they had decided to
use to hide the rose leaves in.</p>

<p>They listened at the other door, got safely
into the passage and up to their rooms. Caroline
pulled off her wet things, put on her bath
slippers, and crept down with her bath towel to
rub away the water they had dripped on the
floor by the door of the room where the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
staircase was. They feared so wet a patch
might prove a clue to Mrs. Wilmington. But
Mrs. Wilmington was with Rupert, putting
cold bandages on a very hot head, and before
she left him for the night, the stones were dry.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would not like to go down a
secret staircase in the middle of the night and
into an underground passage, even to fetch
rose leaves to cure a sick friend? But the
three C.’s were not afraid of the darkness.
Their mother had always accustomed them to
go about in the dark. It was a sort of game to
them, to feel their way about the house without
a light, and to fetch sweets which their mother
would put ready for them. She used to tell
them exactly where to find the little packets,
and so the dark was always mixed up in their
minds with sweets and expectation and pleasant
things. And they only had to go down the
house stairs in the dark. Directly they got to
the secret stair of course they lighted the candle.</p>

<p>And now you see them in their quilted red
dressing-gowns carrying up the wet sacks of
rose leaves. They felt their way to Rupert’s
room. In it a night-light was burning dimly.
They lighted the dressing-table candles.</p>

<p>‘Hullo!’ said Rupert; ’who’s that?’</p>

<p>‘It’s only us,’ whispered Caroline. ‘Is the
fever very hot?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It is now,’ said Rupert; ‘it was cold just now.
I wish I could go to sleep. I can’t though.
I feel all hot and then all cold. It is beastly.’</p>

<p>‘We’ve brought you something nice and
cool,’ said Charlotte. ‘You get out of bed and
you’ll see.’</p>

<p>Rupert, his eyes very shining, and his cheeks
a bright scarlet, tumbled out of bed in a very
long night-shirt and rolled into the arm-chair by
the bed head. Caroline threw a blanket over
him.</p>

<p>‘I <i>must</i>,’ she said, when he protested; ‘they
always do when you’re ill and they’re making
your bed.’</p>

<p>The children turned back the bedclothes and
emptied three sacks of dripping rose leaves on
to the bed.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Charles, shivering a little himself,
‘get in. I should think that’s enough to
cool the hottest fever.’</p>

<p>Rupert rolled into bed. He was really very
feverish—if he had not been, he would never
have rolled into that couch of wet red rose
leaves.</p>

<p>‘Oh, how ripping,’ he said; ‘it’s lovely; so
cold, so cold. You are bricks to bring them.
And how sweet they are. No! don’t cover me
up. That’s what Mrs. Wilmington does. Let
me get cool.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>‘They always cover you up,’ said Caroline
severely. ‘Lie still, or the spell won’t work.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, is it a spell?’ said Rupert. ‘I thought
it was rose leaves. Sacks of them, sacks and
sacks and sacks and sacks and sacks. Each
sack had a cat, each cat had a kit, you know.
I say, if I talk nonsense, it’s because I want to.
You’re not to think I don’t know it’s nonsense.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not to talk at all, even if you could
talk sense,’ said Charlotte, tucking the bedclothes
very tightly round his neck. ‘Lie still
and say, “I am much better. I am quite well.”
I have an aunt called Emmeline, and she never
has a doctor, and she always says that.’</p>

<p>‘I am much better. I am quite well,’ said
Rupert obediently. ‘I am much better. I am
quite well. I am much better. I am a bell. I
shall ring presently for Mrs. Wilmington. I
have a clapper inside my head. I am much
better. I am a bell.’ And so on, for a very
long time.</p>

<p>‘This is the delirium it talked about,’ said
Caroline in a satisfied tone, and held the
blankets down more firmly.</p>

<p>Presently Rupert began to shiver, and
Charlotte fetched the eiderdowns from the
beds of the three, while the others held the
blankets tightly round Rupert, who now no
longer seemed to know at all what he wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a><br /><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a><br /><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>s
saying, nor who he was saying it to. He talked
about India, and seemed to fancy that Charles
was his ayah and Caroline his syce. Charlotte
he mistook for the Murdstone man, which was
very painful for her. But they held the
blankets tightly round him, even when he said
it was too hot out there in the sun and begged
to have the punkahs set going.</p>

<img src="images/i_216.jpg" width="355" height="597" alt="being tucked in bed" />
<div class="caption">Rupert rolled into bed.</div>
</div>

<p>Then quite suddenly he went to sleep; they
waited a little, and when they were quite sure
that he was asleep, they took up the fur hearth-rug
and put that on his bed for fear he should
take cold, and then, very cold indeed themselves,
but quite certain that their spell had cured
Rupert, they crept back to their own beds—rather
chilly places without their eiderdowns.</p>

<p>‘I <i>know</i> the spell will work,’ were Caroline’s
last words. ‘You’ll see, Rupert will be all right
in the morning.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At five o’clock Mrs. Wilmington crept into
Rupert’s room to see if he needed anything.
The floor was strewn with wet, cold, crushed
rose leaves, and on it lay two wet sheets.
Rupert, rolled in a tangle of blankets, eiderdowns,
and hearth-rug, was sleeping as a healthy
baby sleeps. She laid her hand very gently on
his forehead. It was cool and soft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By breakfast-time Rupert was much better.
The fever had gone.</p>

<p>‘So you see the spell <i>did</i> work,’ said
Caroline. ‘Rupert is much better. I sometimes
think we are much cleverer than grown-up
people think we are. Rupert is <i>much</i>
better.’</p>

<p>But all the three C.’s had dreadful colds in
their heads.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE ROSY CURE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Mrs. Wilmington found Rupert asleep
among the remains of the dewy, crushed
rose leaves, she had the sense not to disturb
him, but to put two more blankets over him and
to let him go on sleeping, while she wrapped
herself in a shawl and spent what was left of the
night on the blue sofa at the end of the four-post
bed.</p>

<p>Uncle Charles, coming down, neat and
early, to his study, was met by a very pale
housekeeper with prim lips tightly set, who
said:</p>

<p>‘If you please, sir, them children leave this
house or else I do. I mean those children.’</p>

<p>‘What have they been doing now?’ asked
the Uncle wearily. He had thought of a new
idea about Coptic magic while he was shaving,
and he wanted to be alone with his idea and
his breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Doing their very best to murder that poor
young gentleman in his very bed,’ said the
housekeeper, looking like a thin portrait of
Mrs. Siddons.</p>

<p>‘Did they put flowers and things into the
boy’s food or drink?’ the Uncle asked,
frowning.</p>

<p>‘Worse, sir, far worse. They put him into
flowers and things. And I’ve taken the
liberty of sending for the doctor. And, please,
mayn’t I pack their boxes? No one’s lives is
safe—are, I mean.’ Mrs. Wilmington sniffed
and got out her handkerchief.</p>

<p>‘Please control yourself,’ said the Uncle.
‘I will inquire into what you have told me,
and I will see the doctor when he has seen the
boy. In the meantime, kindly refrain from
further fuss. And, please, tell the cook to serve
another omelette and some fresh tea. These
are no longer warm enough for human food.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington put her handkerchief in
her pocket and went back to Rupert, who was
now wriggling among the blankets and asking
what he could have to eat.</p>

<p>Rupert was much better. There was not a
doubt of it. Harriet had told the children as
much, in confidence, when she brought their
breakfast.</p>

<p>‘But Mrs. W. she is in a paddy and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
error,’ Harriet assured them. ‘A regular
fanteague she’s in. I wouldn’t be you for
something. However you come to think of
such things beats me. An’ she was on at the
Master before he was up a’most about it, going
on something chronic.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’ Charlotte asked.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I know more then you think, Miss,’
said Harriet, tossing her head. ‘I’ve ways of
my own of finding out what <i>I</i> want to know.
I know a sure spell to find out the gentleman’s
name you’re going to marry,’ she added rather
in a hurry. ‘I’ll show you some time, if this
blows over and you don’t have to leave on
account of it.’</p>

<p>‘Bother marrying,’ said Charlotte briefly.
‘I don’t mean to marry any one. I shall be an
Arctic explorer, and sail in the cold waters of
the North.’</p>

<p>‘It’s hot water you’ll be in first,’ said
Harriet. ‘Don’t answer her back’s my advice.
Then p’raps it’ll blow over. Least said soonest
mended’s what I say. They can’t go on at
you for ever if you don’t answer ’em back.’</p>

<p>‘If you don’t answer they say you’re
sulky,’ said Charles, who sometimes noticed
things.</p>

<p>‘No, they don’t, Master Charles; not if you
keep on saying “Yes’m” and “No’m” every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
time they stops for breath. That’s the way to
egg-sauce ’em, trust me it is.’</p>

<p>The three C.’s did not quite see their way to
exhaust Mrs. Wilmington by saying “Yes’m”
and “No’m” in answer to her reproaches, and
they felt that she would not understand if they
tried to explain why they had done what they
did do. So they had rather a poor time with
Mrs. Wilmington, who said a good deal about
the rose leaves, and told them they might have
been the death of Rupert, ‘when really,’ as
Caroline said afterwards, ‘they had been the
life and soul of his getting better.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington also told them that they
were not to think of going out and getting into
any more of their dangerous mischief, because
their uncle was going to give them a right-down
good talking to as soon as the doctor
had been.</p>

<p>‘But we may go out to-morrow, mayn’t
we?’ Charles asked hopefully. And Mrs.
Wilmington replied:</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you won’t be here to-morrow’—a
very disquieting remark.</p>

<p>The children remained in the dining-room
waiting for that right-down good talking to;
and you know what a hateful thing that is to
wait for. They sat there miserably, wondering
whether Mrs. Wilmington could possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
happen by any extraordinary accident to be
right for once, and whether they <i>had</i> done
Rupert any harm. They tried to console
themselves by saying every half minute or so,
‘But Rupert is better, all the same,’ and
‘Whatever she says, Rupert is better,’ and
things like that.</p>

<p>One thing all felt, that they must see the
doctor and know if they really had done any
harm. Thoughts of concealing themselves in
the wardrobe in Rupert’s room, and listening
to the doctor’s wise words at the bedside, were
dismissed, partly owing to an honourable feeling
about listening, and partly because Mrs.
Wilmington didn’t give them any opportunities
for that sort of concealment. Listening at the
Uncle’s door when the doctor had come down
and been shown into the study was also impossible,
for the same reasons. The only
thing they could do was to keep the dining-room
door open.</p>

<p>‘And pounce,’ said Caroline. ‘If we
pounce, suddenly and well, we shall be able to
say, “How is Rupert; is he really worse or
better?” before any one can stop us. And the
doctor is a gentleman. He must answer a
lady’s question.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not ladies, you’re only little girls,’
said Charles. But the others made allowances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
It was a time of trial. Caroline answered
with that soft answer which is sometimes so
hard to bear:</p>

<p>‘Yes, dear Charles, we are. Aunt Emmeline
says you cannot begin to be a lady too
soon, and that is why you must wipe your
mouth before drinking as well as after, and
never interrupt, and put on your gloves <i>before</i>
you go out, and things like that. And when I
gave my penny to the crossing-sweeper, you
know, that muddy Friday, he said I was a real
little lady. You <i>must</i> remember that day,
Charles—the day you upset the ink over my
<i>Hereward the Wake</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Here, I say, chuck it,’ said Charles, rather
red. ‘I never——’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Pax, for goodness’ sake,’ said Charlotte;
‘if we begin ragging just when we ought to
stand by each other, we’re like deserters.
United we stand, divided we fall a victim to
the Wilmington. Hark! that’s the Uncle’s
door.’</p>

<p>They flung themselves into the hall; and
the astonished doctor, just saying a few last
words of politeness to Uncle Charles, was met
by a charge of children all firmly asking, ‘How
is Rupert? Is he worse? Is he better?
Did we really do him any harm?’</p>

<p>‘He’s much better,’ said the doctor, rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
his hands cheerfully; ‘your rose leaves were
a variant of what is known as the packing
treatment. You did him a world of good.
But,’ he added hastily, as Uncle Charles, behind
him, uttered the ghost of a grunt, and Mrs.
Wilmington, from the top of the stairs, coughed
loudly and expressively, ‘it might have been
very dangerous, very. Verdict: not guilty,
but don’t do it again.’</p>

<p>And with that he laughed in a jolly, red-faced
way, and went out of the front door and
on to his horse and rode away.</p>

<p>‘And <i>now</i>,’ said the Uncle, leading the way
back into the dining-room.</p>

<p>I will draw a veil over that scene. A right-down
good talking to is never a pleasant thing
to record. And I am not sure whether the
three C.’s deserved this one or not. Was it
chance or magic that made them do exactly
the right thing for Rupert? Of course they
explained fully to the Uncle that as it was a
threefold spell it was bound to act exactly as
it had acted. He shook his head, did not
smile, and went on talking about responsibility
and carefulness and so on. He really did smile
when Charlotte, very near to tears, explained
that they had only been acting like the Rosicurians
in olden days. But he hid his smile in
his handkerchief, and the children did not see it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>‘And now—’ said the Uncle once again,
and paused. The three children knew those
words well, and each wondered what their
punishment was to be.</p>

<p>‘I hope it won’t be lines,’ Charles told himself.
‘I’d rather anything than lines.’</p>

<p>‘I hope it won’t be keeping us in,’ thought
Caroline. ‘I’d rather anything than be kept
in. And such a fine day too.’</p>

<p>And still the Uncle paused, till Charlotte
could bear it no longer. She did not stop to
think what she would rather the punishment
was or wasn’t. She said, ‘Oh, uncle, we
really didn’t mean to be naughty! And it
really hasn’t hurt him. But we don’t want to
shirk. Only don’t keep us suspended. Let
us know the worst. Are we to be hanged for
a sheep as a lamb? You know you’re hanged
twice if you’re hanged quickly. We’ll do
whatever you say, and we don’t mind being
punished if you think we ought. Only don’t
do what the Wil—I mean, Mrs. Wilmington,
said.’</p>

<p>‘What did she say?’</p>

<p>‘She said perhaps we shouldn’t be here
to-morrow. Oh!’ said Charlotte, and began
to cry. So did Caroline. Charles put his
hands in his pockets and sniffed.</p>

<p>‘Don’t!’ said the Uncle earnestly; ‘please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
don’t. I have said what I felt it my duty to
say. But it is all over. I certainly have no
intention of punishing you for what was a
mistake. What I blame you for is—well,
briefly, interference, and taking too much on
yourselves.’</p>

<p>‘Shoving our oar in,’ sobbed Charlotte.
‘But we did so want Rupert to be better.’</p>

<p>‘He is better,’ said the Uncle. ‘<i>Please</i>
don’t cry. It is over now. But I must ask
for a promise.’</p>

<p>‘We did keep the other promise,’ Charles
reminded him.</p>

<p>‘I know you did. This is more comprehensive
as well as more definite. I want you to
promise me that you will not only refrain from
administering your remedies internally, but
that you will not make any external application
of them to any of your friends—or enemies,’
he added hastily.</p>

<p>‘Not put them on to people’s outsides?—yes,’
murmured Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Without consulting me. If you wish to
try any more experiments, the simple presentation
of a symbolic bouquet should be enough.
It was enough in my case. You remember.’</p>

<p>‘Of course we promise,’ said every one.</p>

<p>‘Oh, uncle, you are kind not to be crosser!’</p>

<p>‘We don’t really mean to do wrong.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But you can’t do right without it turning
out wrong sometimes. You can’t just do
nothing,’ said Caroline; ‘though really it’s the
only safe way. Things do so turn out wrong
that you didn’t think would.’</p>

<p>‘They do,’ said the Uncle. ‘Now dry your
eyes and run out and play. And if you see
your way to letting Mrs. Wilmington know
that you’re sorry, it <i>would</i> perhaps be well.’</p>

<p>‘Of course we will if you want us to,’ they
said; and Charlotte added:</p>

<p>‘It <i>will</i> be well. She always says it is.’</p>

<p>‘Always says what is what?’</p>

<p>‘She always says everything’s all very well
when we say we’re sorry.’</p>

<p>Then they went round to the terraced
garden and sat on the grass and talked it all
over.</p>

<p>‘And if ever there was an angel uncle, ours
is it,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charles, ‘and Rupert is better.
I’m glad we did it, aren’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I suppose so. Yes. No. Yes. I don’t
know,’ said Caroline. ‘You see the spell
worked. That’s a great thing to be sure of,
anyhow.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the one thing, however, that they
couldn’t persuade Rupert to be sure of. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was certainly better, but, as he pointed out,
he might have got better without the rose
leaves.</p>

<p>‘Of course it was jolly decent of you to get
them, and all that,’ he said; ‘but the medicine
the doctor gave me cured me, I expect. I
don’t want to be ungrateful, but what are
doctors for, anyhow?’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> don’t know,’ said Charles, ‘but I know you
jolly well tried fern-seed when you pretended
to be invisible.’</p>

<p>‘I feel much older than I did then,’ said
Rupert, biting ends of grass as he lay on the
dry crisp turf. It was the first day of his
being loosed from those bonds which hamper
the movements of persons who have been
ill. You know the sort of times when you feel
perfectly well, and yet, merely because you
have a cold or measles or something, you are
kept in when you want to go out, and sent out
(in what is called ‘the best of the day’) when
you want to stay in, and little driblets of
medicine are brought you when you feel least
need of them, and glasses of hot milk and cups
of beef-tea occur just when you are thinking
fondly of roast beef and suet pudding, and you
are assured that what <i>you</i> need is not heavy
food like pudding and beef, but something
light and at the same time nourishing. Also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
you have to go to bed earlier than the others
and not to sit in draughts.</p>

<p>However, all this was now over for Rupert,
and he was one of the others, on a natural
meal-footing. His parents, by the way, had
telegraphed thanking Uncle Charles very
much, and accepting his invitation for Rupert
to spend the rest of the holidays at the
Manor House. They had also telegraphed
to the Murdstone master telling him that
Rupert would not return to him. So that
now there seemed to be no bar to complete
enjoyment, except that one little fact that
Rupert wouldn’t believe in spells.</p>

<p>‘But the fern-seed acted,’ said Caroline,
‘and the secret rose acted, and the Rosicurian
rose leaves acted.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t see how you can say the fern-seed
acted. I wasn’t invisible, because you all saw
me through the window.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but,’ said Charlotte eagerly, ‘don’t you
see? You <i>wanted</i> us to see you. You can’t
expect a spell to act if you don’t want it to act.
I wouldn’t myself, if I was a spell.’</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t that at all,’ said Caroline; ‘don’t
you remember <i>we</i> chewed the fern-seed to
make us see invisible things, and we saw <i>you</i>.
And you <i>were</i> invisible, because you’d chewed
fern-seed too. It came out just perfectly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Only you won’t see it. But let’s try it again
if you like—the fern-seed, I mean.’</p>

<p>But Rupert wouldn’t. He preferred to
read <i>The Dog Crusoe</i>, lying on his front upon
the grass. The others also got books.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE MINERAL WOMAN</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> day Rupert felt more alive, as he
explained.</p>

<p>‘Now, look here,’ he said at breakfast,
‘suppose we go and discover the North
Pole.’</p>

<p>‘That <i>would</i> be nice,’ said Caroline; ‘the
attics? We’ve never explored them yet.’</p>

<p>‘No, attics are for wet days,’ said Rupert.</p>

<p>‘Not the real North Pole, you don’t
mean?’ said Charles, quite ready to believe
that Rupert might mean anything, however
wonderful and adventurous.</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Rupert; ‘what I thought of was
a <i>via medias res</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Latin,’ explained Charles to the girls.</p>

<p>‘It means a middle way. You ask your
uncle to let us take our lunch out, bread and
cheese and cake will do; and to not expect
us till tea-time, and perhaps not then. We’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
just go where we think we will, and shut our
eyes when we pass signposts and post-offices.
We might get lost, you know, but I’d take care
of you.’</p>

<p>‘We mustn’t disturb the Uncle,’ Caroline
reminded them. ‘We promised. Not for a
week.’</p>

<p>‘Write him a letter,’ said Rupert. And
this is the letter they wrote. At least Caroline
wrote it and they all signed their names.</p>

<p>‘Dearest Uncle’ (‘Dearest is rot,’ said
Charles, looking at Rupert to be sure that he
thought so too; ‘put Dear’).</p>

<p>‘But Dear is rottener,’ answered Caroline,
going on; ‘it’s what you say to the butcher
when you write about the ribs that ought to
have been Sir Something. <i>I</i> know.’</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Please may we go out for the day and take our
lunch, bread and cheese and cake would do, Rupert
says he will take care of us, and not expect us home
till tea, and perhaps not then, with love</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Caroline</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Charlotte</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Charles</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>‘Rupert can’t sign because he’s “he” in the
letter. Only the “we’s” can sign,’ said Caroline.
And Harriet took the letter to the
Uncle, and the Uncle wrote back:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By all means. I am sure you will remember
not to administer spells internally or externally to
any one you may meet. Be home by half-past six.
If anything should detain you, send a telegram. I
enclose 2s. 6d. for incidental expenses.—Your dearest</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Uncle</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>‘How sweet of him,’ the girls agreed, and
Charles wanted to know what sort of expenses
he meant.</p>

<p>‘“Incidental”? Oh, if you want an apple or
some chocks in a hurry and don’t happen to have
any on you,’ Rupert explained. ‘Or ginger
beer. Or raw eggs to suck as you go along;
they’re very sustaining when all other food’s
despaired of.’</p>

<p>The Uncle must have given orders, for
Harriet soon brought in four neat brown-paper
parcels.</p>

<p>‘Your lunches,’ she said. ‘Hope you’ll
enjoy yourselves. You’ve got a nice day for
your outing. Bring me a keepsake, won’t you?
from wherever it is you’re going to.’</p>

<p>‘Of course we will,’ said Charlotte. ‘What
would you like?’</p>

<p>But Harriet laughed, and said she was only
talking.</p>

<p>They put on their thinnest clothes, for it was
a very hot day, and they got William to cut
them ash-sticks, ‘in case we want to be pilgrim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>s
with staffs,’ said Charles. The girls were very
anxious for Rupert to wear his school blazer,
and so flattering were their opinions of it, and
of him, and of it on him, and of him in it, that
he consented. Charles wore <i>his</i> school blazer,
and the girls’ frocks were of blue muslin, and
they had their soft white muslin hats, so they
looked very bright and yet very cool as they
started off down the drive with their ash-sticks
over their shoulders and their brown-paper
parcels in knotted handkerchiefs dangling from
the ends of the sticks.</p>

<p>‘Who shall we be?’ Charlotte asked, as
they passed into the shadow of the woods
where the road runs through to the lodge gate.</p>

<p>‘I’ll be Nansen,’ said Charles. ‘I wish we
had some Equismo dogs and a sledge.’</p>

<p>‘It’s Eskimo,’ said Rupert.</p>

<p>‘I know it is,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘I don’t believe you did,’ said Rupert, and
Charles turned red and the girls looked at each
other uncomfortably.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t say I did,’ Charles answered. ‘Not
when I said it first. I meant I know now you’ve
told me. It looked like Equismo in the books.’</p>

<p>This was disarming. Rupert could do no
less than thump Charles on the back and say,
‘Sorry, old man’; and Caroline hastened to
say, ‘What will <i>you</i> be, Rupert?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Why, Rupert, of course. Prince Rupert.
He invented Prince Rupert drops that are glass
and crumble to powder if you look at them too
hard. And he fought at Naseby—Rupert of
the Rhine, you know. “For Charles, King
of England, and Rupert of the Rhine!”’ he
shouted.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I say,’ Charles urged, ‘do let me be
Charles if you’re Rupert. It’s only fair.’</p>

<p>‘You can’t keep changing,’ said Rupert.
‘Besides, Charles had his head chopped off
afterwards.’</p>

<p>‘Well, Rupert died too, if you come to that.
You might, Rupert.’</p>

<p>And the girls said, ‘Do let him’; so Rupert
said, ‘All right, he didn’t mind.’</p>

<p>Charlotte said she thought she would be
Charles the Second, because he was a merry
monarch; but it was decided that it might be
confusing to have two Charles’s; so she had
to be content with being Joan of Arc, while
Caroline was Boadicea.</p>

<p>‘She was British, you see,’ Caroline explained;
‘and Aunt Emmeline says you ought
to support home industries.’</p>

<p>‘Now we all call each other by our play
names all day,’ Charlotte said, ‘and if you make
a mistake you lose a mark.’</p>

<p>‘Who keeps the marks?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You keep your own, of course—counting
on your fingers. And if you did it ten times,
you’d tie a knot in your handkerchief. Aunts do
it ten times if they play often. <i>We</i> don’t.’</p>

<p>Here Boadicea, Joan of Arc, Prince Rupert,
and King Charles turned out of the lodge gate,
and the exploring expedition began at seventeen
minutes past ten, precisely. The three C.’s kept
up the game, calling each other by the new
names with frequency and accurateness; but
Rupert grew more and more silent, and when
Charlotte addressed him as Prince Rupert the
stainless knight, he told her not to be silly.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past twelve, the four children,
very dusty, very hot and rather tired, reached
a level crossing. The gates were shut because
a train was coming, and already, as you looked
along the line, you could see the front of the
engine getting bigger and blacker, and the
steam from it getting whiter and puffier, and
you could feel the vibration of its coming in
the shuddering of the gate as you leaned
on it.</p>

<p>The train stopped, in a snorting, panting
hurry, at the little station just beside the gates,
let out a few passengers, shook itself impatiently,
screamed, and went on. The big
gates across the road swung slowly back till
they stretched across the railway, and the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
who had got out of the train came down the
sloping end of the platform and through the
small swing-gates, and the four children, who
were crossing the line, met the little crowd from
the train half-way. There were two women
with baskets, a man with a bandy-legged dog,
and a girl with a large band-box partly hidden
by brown paper, and—the four children were
face to face with him before they knew that
there was any one coming from that train whom
they had rather not be face to face with—the
Murdstone man himself. He was not a yard
from them. Rupert threw up his head and
backed a little as if he expected to be hit. The
three C.’s breathed a deep concerted ‘Oh!’ and
trembled on the edge of what might be going
to happen. No one knew what Mr. Murdstone’s
power might be. Could he seize on
Rupert and take him away? Could he call the
police? Anything seemed possible in that
terrible instant when they were confronted,
suddenly and beyond hope of retreat, with the
hated master.</p>

<p>And nothing happened at all. The Murdstone
man passed by. He gave a cold, sour,
unrecognising glance at the three C.’s, but he
never looked at Rupert. He looked over his
head as though Rupert had not been there, and
passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a><br /><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert grew very red and said nothing.
The girls looked at each other.</p>

<p>‘Let’s walk along by the river,’ said Caroline,
‘and then we’ll tell you why he didn’t look at
you.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll tell me now,’ said Rupert firmly, ‘or
I won’t go another step.’</p>

<p>‘He didn’t look at you,’ said Charlotte,
‘because he didn’t see you. And he didn’t see
you because you were invisible just when you
wanted to be.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t want to be,’ said Rupert; ‘at least—— Oh,
well, come on.’</p>

<p>When they had reached a green meadow
that sloped pleasantly to the willow-fringed
edge of the river Medway, Charlotte said:</p>

<p>‘You <i>were</i> invisible, to him. That’s the
magic. Perhaps you’ll believe in spells now.’</p>

<p>‘But there wasn’t any spell,’ said Rupert
impatiently.</p>

<p>And the girls said with one voice, ‘You
take off your blazer and see.’</p>

<p>‘I hate hanky panky,’ said Rupert, but he
took off the coat.</p>

<p>‘Look, in there,’ said Caroline, turning back
that loose fold which the button-holes are made
in—‘<i>fern-seed</i>. Char and I seccotined it on
while you and Charles were washing your
hands. We meant to ask you to wish to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
invisible when we went into a shop or something,
just to prove about spells, but you did it
without our asking. And now you <i>will</i> believe,
won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I <i>can’t</i>,’ said Rupert; ‘don’t talk about it
any more. Let’s have the grub out.’</p>

<p>They opened the parcels and ‘had the grub
out,’ and it was sandwiches, and jam-tarts packed
face to face, and raspberries in a card-board box
that had once held chocolates—that was in
Rupert’s parcel—and biscuits, and large wedges
of that pleasant solid cake which you still get
sometimes in old-fashioned houses where baking
powder and self-raising flour are unknown.</p>

<p>‘This is the first picnic we’ve ever had by
ourselves; don’t you like it, Prince Rupert?’</p>

<p>Rupert’s mouth was full of sandwich. He
was understood to say that it was ‘all right.’</p>

<p>‘King Charles is gracefully pleased to like
it,’ said Charles. ‘Boadicea had better pour out
the Rhine wine, for it’s a thirsty day.’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Boadicea in stricken tones,
‘there isn’t any!’</p>

<p>And there wasn’t. Not a drop of milk or
water or ginger-beer or anything drinkable.
No nephew or niece of Aunt Emmeline’s was
likely to do anything so rash as drinking water
from a strange river to which it had not been
properly introduced, so there was nothing to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
done but to eat the raspberries and pretend
that raspberries quenched thirst, which, as you
probably know only too well, they don’t.</p>

<p>This was why, when they had eaten everything
there was to eat, and buried the bits of
paper deeply in a hollow tree, so as not to spoil
the pretty picture of green willows and blue-green
water and grass-green grass, they set
out to find a cottage where ginger-beer was
sold. There was such a cottage, and they had
passed it on the way. It had a neat gay little
garden and a yellow rose clambering over its
porch, and on one of its red brick sides was a
pear-tree that went up the wall with level
branches like a double ladder, and on the other
a deep-blue iron plate which said in plain white
words ‘Bateyes Minerals.’ A stranger from
Queen Victoria’s early days might have supposed
this to mean that the cottage had a small
museum of geological specimens such as you
find now and then in Derbyshire; but Rupert
and the three C.’s knew that ‘Minerals’ was
just short for ginger-beer and other things
that fizz.</p>

<p>So, after making sure that they had not
lost their two shillings and their sixpence, they
unlatched the white gate and went in.</p>

<p>The front door, which was green and had
no knocker, was open, and one could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
straight into the cottage’s front parlour. It
was very neat and oil-clothy, with sea-shells on
pink wool mats, and curly glass vases, and a
loud green-faced clock on the mantelpiece.
There was a horse-hair sofa and more white
crochet antimacassars than you would have
thought possible even in the most respectable
sea-side lodgings. A black and white cat was
asleep in the sun, edged in among the pots
of geraniums that filled the window. In fact,
it was a very clean example of the cottage
homes of England, how beautiful they stand!</p>

<p>The thirsty children waited politely as long
as they could bear to wait, and then Caroline
tip-toed across the speckless brown-and-blue
linoleum and tapped at the inner door. Nothing
happened. So she pushed the door, which
was ajar, a little more open and looked through
it. Then she turned, shook her head, made a
baffling sign to the others to stay where they
were, and went through the door and shut it
after her.</p>

<p>The others waited; the sign Caroline had
made was a secret one only used in really
serious emergencies.</p>

<p>‘I expect there’s a bird in there and she
wants to catch it,’ said Charles; but the others
could not believe this, and they were right.</p>

<p>Quite soon Caroline returned bearing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
wrinkled black tray with three bottles of
lemonade, three glasses, and the little round
wooden thing that you press the glass marble
down with into the neck of the bottle.</p>

<p>‘Here,’ she said in a hurry, ‘you go round
to the other side of the cottage, and there’s a
hornbeam arbour and a bench and table, and
you’re very welcome to sit there. I’ll tell you
all about it afterwards,’ she added, whispering.
‘Only <i>do</i> take it and go.’</p>

<p>‘But what <i>is</i> it?’ Rupert asked.</p>

<p>‘She’s crying dreadfully. I don’t know what
it is yet. Oh, <i>do go</i>.’</p>

<p>And she thrust the tray on him and went
back through the door with an air of importance
which even the others found just a little
trying. However, they were thirsty and loyal,
so they did as they were asked to do; found
the hornbeam arbour, and settled down on the
blue-painted benches to drink their lemonade
and tell each other how thirsty they had been,
drawing deep breaths between the draughts to
say so with.</p>

<p>Caroline, in the meantime, was in the back
kitchen of the strange cottage gently patting
the shoulder of a perfect stranger, who sat with
her elbows on the mangle and her head in her
hands crying, crying, crying.</p>

<p>‘Don’t! oh, please don’t!’ said Caroline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
again and again; and again and again the
woman who was crying said, ‘Go away. I
can’t attend to you. Go away!’</p>

<p>She was a middle-aged woman, and her
dark hair, streaked with grey, was screwed up
behind in a tight knob. Her sleeves were
tucked up, and all round her were piles of
those square boxes with wooden divisions in
which lemonade and ginger-beer travel about.
The boxes were dotted with greeny bottles,
some full, some empty, and the boxes were
everywhere—on the sink, under the sink, on
the copper, on the bricks, and outside the open
back door.</p>

<p>‘Don’t cry,’ said Caroline in a voice that
would have soothed an angry bear. ‘<i>Do</i> tell
me what’s the matter. I might be able to
help you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, go along, do!’ said the woman, trying
to dry her eyes with a corner of a blue-checked
apron. ‘You seem a kind little gell, but it
ain’t no good. Run along, dearie.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ said Caroline, ‘if you don’t stop
crying, how am I going to pay you for the
lemonade I took when you said I might?
Three bottles it was.’</p>

<p>‘Sixpence,’ said the woman, sniffing.</p>

<p>‘You poor dear,’ said Caroline, and put her
arms round the woman’s neck. ‘Now,’ she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a><br /><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a><br /><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
said comfortably, ‘you just fancy I’m your own
little girl and tell me what’s the matter.’</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 374px;">
<img src="images/i_248.jpg" width="374" height="591" alt="woman holding head by sewing maching, Caroline behind her" />
<div class="caption">‘I can’t attend to you. Go away!‘</div>
</div>

<p>The woman turned her face and kissed
Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Bless you for a silly little duck,’ she said.
‘My own little gell’s in service over Tonbridge
way. It’s silly of me taking on like that.
But it come so sudden.’</p>

<p>‘What did?’ Caroline asked. ‘Do tell
me. Perhaps I can help. I’ve got an uncle,
and I know he’d give me some money for you,
if that’s it. And, besides, I can make nice
things happen sometimes—I really can.’</p>

<p>‘It isn’t money,’ said the woman drearily,
‘and I don’t know why I should tell you.’</p>

<p>‘It eases the heart, you know,’ said Caroline;
‘my aunt says it does. Do tell me. I’m <i>so</i>
sorry you’re unhappy.’</p>

<p>‘You wouldn’t understand,’ said the woman,
drying her eyes. ‘It’s silly, I know. But I
only heard this morning, and just now it all
come over me when I was sorting out the
bottles. I was born in the little house, you
see, and lived here all my life. And now to
leave! A week’s notice too! Where’m I to
go to? How’m I to manage? What’m I
to get my living by? You see, being right
on the highroad I get all the thirsty customers
as they comes by. Where’m I to go to?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
There’s a cottage back by Wright’s farm;
ne’er a bit of garden to it, and nobody passes
it one year’s end to another. I’d never sell a
single bottle if I lived there to be a hundred.’</p>

<p>‘But why must you leave here?’ Caroline
asked.</p>

<p>‘Gentlefolks,’ said the woman bitterly; ‘got
a grand ’ouse of their own up in London.
But they gone and took a fancy to my little bit,
’cause it looks so pretty with the flowers I
planted, and the arbour my father made, and
the roses as come from mother’s brother in
Cambridgeshire.</p>

<p>‘“Such a sweet pretty cottage to stay in
for week-ends,” they says; an’ <i>I</i> may go to
the Union and stay there, week in, week out,
and much they care. There’s something like
it in the Bible, only there ain’t no prophets now
like there was of old to go and rebuke the
folks that takes away poor folks’ vineyards and
lambs and things to make week-end cottages
of. And of course they can pay for their
fancy. An’ it comes a bit ’ard, my dear. An’
that’s all. So now you know.’</p>

<p>‘But that’s dreadful,’ said Caroline; ‘the
landlord must be a very wicked man.’</p>

<p>‘It ain’t <i>’is</i> doing,’ said the woman, sorting
bottles swiftly; ‘’e’s but a lad when all’s said
and done. Comes of age in a week or two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Ain’t never been ’is own master yet, so to say.
It’s ’is cousin as manages the property. ’E’s
got it into ’is ’ead to screw another shilling or
two out of us somehow; ’ere, there, and everywhere,
as they say. To pay for the harches
and the flags when Milord comes of age, I
suppose. Now you see you can’t do anything,
so run along, lovey. You’re a good little gell
to trouble about it, and you’re the only one
that has. It’ll come home to you all right,
never fear. Kind words is never lost, nor
acts neither. Good day to you, Missy.’</p>

<p>‘Good-bye,’ said Caroline; ‘but I’m not so
sure that I can’t do anything. I’ll ask my uncle.
Perhaps he knows my Lord, whoever it is.’</p>

<p>‘Andore,’ said the woman; ‘but nobody don’t
know him about here. He’s been abroad for
his education, being weak in the chest from a
child. But it ain’t no good, dearie. I’ll ’ave to
go, same as other folks as ’ad to go afore me.’</p>

<p>‘I shall think of something, you see if I
don’t,’ said Caroline. ‘I’ve got an aunt as
well as an uncle, and she says you can make
things happen. You just keep on saying,
“Everything’s going to be all right. I’m not
going to worry.” And then everything <i>will</i> be
all right. You’ll see. And I’ll come again
to-morrow or next day. Good-bye, dear.’</p>

<p>She kissed the woman, paid the sixpence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and went out to the hornbeam arbour with the
air of one who has a mission.</p>

<p>‘Come on,’ she said; ‘I’ll tell you as we go
along. No, I’m not thirsty now. Oh, well, if
you’ve saved some for me. That was jolly
decent of you.’ She drank. ‘Now,’ she said,
‘there’s not a moment to be lost; it’s a matter
of life and death to the Mineral woman. Come
on.’</p>

<p>And as they went back along the dusty road
she told them what had happened.</p>

<p>‘I must ask the Uncle <i>at once</i> if he knows
Lord Andore,’ she said; ‘and he can telegraph
to him like he did to India, and then everything
will be all right.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ said Charlotte, ‘we promised we
wouldn’t disturb him <i>for anything</i>. Suppose
he doesn’t appear at tea?’</p>

<p>‘Then we must do something else,’ said
Caroline. ‘It’s the realest thing I’ve ever had
the chance of doing—except you, Rupert,’ she
added politely; ‘and if we can’t get at the
Uncle we’ll try a spell. Every single spell
we’ve tried has come right. First the fern-seed;
then the——’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know,’ said Rupert hastily, ‘and it’s
all right to play at. But this is a real thing.
I’ve got a godfather that’s a baronet. I’ll write
to him to go to the House of Lords and tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
this Lord Andore. Appeal to Cæsar himself,
don’t you know. How’s that?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, do,’ said Charlotte; ‘but we’ll work the
spell as well. We may as well have two
strings to our harp like that blind girl in the
picture. What spell can we do?’</p>

<p>‘We’ll look it up in the books,’ Caroline said
importantly; ‘and, Rupert, if we pull it off and
she doesn’t get turned out of her house, you
will believe the spell, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I’ll try,’ said Rupert cautiously; ‘and, anyway,
I’ll write to my godfather. Only he’s in
Norway. I’d better telegraph, perhaps?’</p>

<p>‘It’ll cost pounds, won’t it?’ said Charles
admiringly.</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Rupert carelessly. ‘Mrs.
Wilmington will lend me the chink till I get
my allowance. Let’s do the thing properly
while we’re about it. You may as well be
hanged for a sheep as——’</p>

<p>‘As a cow. Yes, indeed,’ said Charlotte with
approval.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>JUSTICE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> great discovery was Charlotte’s. When
they got home and found that the Uncle had
gone to Tonbridge for the day, every one
felt that something must be done, and Rupert
began to write out the telegram to his godfather.
It was quite a nice telegram, very
long, and explaining everything perfectly, but
Mrs. Wilmington unexpectedly refused to lend
more than ninepence, so it could not be sent.
Caroline sat rocking herself to and fro, with her
fingers in her ears to shut out Charles’s
comments and advice, and tried in vain to think
of some way of using a spell to help the
Mineral woman.</p>

<p>‘It’s no use, you know,’ Charles said,
‘looking up the spells in the books until we
know how we’re going to use it.’ And Caroline
had to agree that this was so. So she rocked
herself and racked her brains and felt herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
growing slowly more and more stupid, as you
do when you are trying very hard to think of
something that has made up its mind that it is
not going to be thought about.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ Charlotte went on, ‘we mustn’t
give the wicked cousin anything to eat to make
him good, and most likely we couldn’t get at
him to make him eat it, even if we were
allowed. What a pity we can’t get at the Lord
with a foreign education, weak from a child. I
daresay we could make him take things. When
you’re weak from a child they give you just
anything.’</p>

<p>‘That’s true,’ said Rupert. ‘I knew a chap
with a flat chest that had cod-liver oil given him—with
oranges. But he said even the oranges
weren’t worth it.’</p>

<p>‘But we aren’t allowed to give people things
to eat,’ Charlotte reminded him.</p>

<p>‘Besides,’ Rupert reminded <i>her</i>, ‘we don’t
know the weak Lord’s address.’</p>

<p>‘I do,’ said Caroline, taking her fingers out
of her ears, though really she could hear almost
as well with them in.</p>

<p>‘Then,’ said Charlotte, ‘let’s go and see
him. Let’s appeal to Cæsar.’</p>

<p>‘But he’s got two addresses,’ said Caroline,
‘and we don’t know which he’s at. I mean,
the Mineral woman didn’t.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Try both,’ suggested Rupert.</p>

<p>‘But one’s in London,’ said Caroline. ‘The
Mineral woman said: “He’s all right: he’s got
the castle and he’s got his mansion in Belgrave
Square; I can’t expect him to bother about me
and my little house.”’</p>

<p>Charlotte sprang up. ‘Let’s go to the
castle, and if he’s not there, we’ll get another
take-your-lunch-with-you-cheese-and-cake-will-do
day and go to London and see him there.’</p>

<p>The brilliant daring of this idea made the
others gasp.</p>

<p>‘Do you mean go <i>now?</i>’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Why not? There’s lots of the day left.
It’s not half-past three yet.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t know where the castle is,’
Rupert objected.</p>

<p>‘Yes, I do,’ said Caroline; ‘so there!
William said the day of the Rupert hunt—he
said, “I hoped the boy’d got into the castle
grounds. Milord’s men ’ud have sent Poad
about his business pretty sharp if he’d gone
trespassing there.” So it can’t be far off.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll tell you what,’ said Charlotte. ‘You
know uncle said the day after we’d been
Rosicurians would we like the carriage to go
and see Mr. Penfold, only we didn’t, because we
knew he’d gone to Canterbury. Now if we
could only persuade William that going to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Lord Andore is the same thing as going to see
Mr. Penfold, and that to-day is the same as the
other day, well then—— People think so much
more of you if you go in a carriage—servants,
I mean, and people who don’t know about
sterling worth, and its being better to be good
than pretty, and all not being gold that
glitters.’</p>

<p>‘And what will you do when you get there?’
Rupert asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>‘Why, give him a bunch of magic flowers,
and tell him about the Mineral woman.’</p>

<p>‘You’ll look very silly,’ Rupert told her,
‘driving up to a lord’s house with your two-penny-halfpenny
flowers, when he’s got acres
of glass most likely.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t care if he’s got miles of glass, and
vineries and pineries of every modern inconvenience.
He hasn’t got flowers that grow as
true and straight as the ones in the wonderful
garden. Thomas told me nobody had in all
the country-side. And they’re magic flowers,
ours are. Oh, Rupert, I wish you wouldn’t be
so grown-up.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not,’ said Rupert; ‘it’s you that’s
silly.’</p>

<p>‘You’re always being different from what
we’d made up our minds you were,’ said
Charlotte hotly; ‘there, now it’s out. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
were sorry for you at first. And then we liked
you; you were so adventurous and splendid.
And then you catch a cold and go all flat.
Why do you do it?’</p>

<p>‘<i>Non semper vivens arcus</i>,’ said Rupert, and
Charles hung on his words. ‘You can’t be
always the same. It would be dull. Besides,
I got such a beastly cold. And I’d had the
adventure. You don’t want to go on having
one dinner after another all day. You want
a change. I’m being sensible, that’s all. I
daresay I shall be silly again some day,’ he
added consolingly. ‘A chap has to be silly or
not <i>moresuis</i>, that means “off his own bat,”
Charles.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charles, ‘I’ll remember.’</p>

<p>‘Well, look here. I’ll go and try it on with
William if you like,’ said Charlotte; ‘but he
likes Caroline best because of what she did
on the Rupert hunt day.’</p>

<p>‘You do rub it in, don’t you?’ said Rupert.
‘I wish sometimes you <i>hadn’t</i> helped me that
day.’</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then Charlotte said,
‘You go, Caro. And Charles, whatever
happens, you must wash your hands. Go on,
like a sensible, and do it now, so as not to waste
time.’</p>

<p>‘<i>Cui bono?</i>’ said Rupert. ‘It’ll be all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
same in a hundred years, or even in five minutes,
if it’s Charles’s hands.’</p>

<p>But Charles went, when Charlotte assured
him that if he didn’t they would go without
him. The moment the door closed behind him
she turned to Rupert.</p>

<p>‘Now, look here,’ she said; ‘I know what’s
the matter with you. You’ve got the black dog
on your back. I don’t know what dog it is or
why. But you have. You haven’t been a bit
nice to-day; you didn’t play up when you were
Rupert of the Rhine—not a bit, you didn’t—and
you think we’re silly kids. And you think
you’re letting yourself down by playing with
us. You didn’t think that the first day
when we saved you. Something’s got into
you. Oh, I do believe you’re bewitched.
Rupert, <i>do</i> you think you’re bewitched?
Because if you are we know how to unbewitch
you.’</p>

<p>‘You’re a very silly little girl,’ was all Rupert
found to say.</p>

<p>‘Not a bit of it,’ said Charlotte brightly.
‘You only say that because you haven’t got
any sisters of your own, so of course you don’t
know. We’ve been as nice to you as ever we
could be, and you’re getting nastier and nastier.
If you like to be nice, <i>be</i> nice. If you don’t, I
shall know it’s not your fault but because you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
bewitched, and I shall pity but not despise you.
So now you know.’</p>

<p>Rupert was twisting and untwisting the
fringed tassel of a sofa-cushion and looking at
the floor.</p>

<p>‘So you hate me now, I suppose?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘No, I don’t. But I hate the black dog.
I thought you were splendid at first. And
even now I think you’re splendid inside,
really. Only something’s happened. It <i>is</i>
like bewitchment, I do think. Couldn’t you
do anything to stop it? I’d help you, really I
would. I say, I’m sorry if I’ve scratched too
hard.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t understand,’ said Rupert with
what was plainly an effort. ‘Sometimes I’m
like this. I feel as if I was some one else. I
can’t explain. Now you can laugh if you like.
I only thought I’d tell you. Don’t tell the
others. It’s perfectly beastly. I suppose I
<i>could</i> help it if I knew the way. Only I don’t.’</p>

<p>‘Suppose you had a bath,’ suggested Charlotte.
‘Aunt Emmeline says when children
feel naughty you should always wash their
faces; and if it’s true of children, it must be true
of bigger people,’ she added hastily, answering
Rupert’s frown, ‘because your face is made of
the same sort of stuff, however old you are.’</p>

<p>‘That was part of it,’ said Rupert, ‘when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
I saw the river to-day. Can you swim? I
can. And I promised my father I’d never
go into the water to swim unless there was
some man there, and—— My father’s in India,
you know,’ he said unnecessarily. ‘It was he
taught me to swim.’ He walked to the window
and looked out. ‘I thought I was going back
to India with him. And then the doctors said
some rotten rigmarole, and my father went without
me, and I was all right again three months
after, and I might as well have gone with him,
only then it was too late; and then things
began to happen that I never thought could.
And nothing will ever be right again.’</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said Charlotte, ‘I’m <i>frightfully</i>
sorry I scratched you, and about your
father and your not going. Look here, don’t
come with us this afternoon. You go down to
Mr. Penfold’s. He’s the clergyman. He said
the other day he’d teach Charles to swim, so I
know he can. If you go directly, he’ll take
you down to the river and you can drown
dull care in the Medway.’</p>

<p>‘Do you think he’d mind?’</p>

<p>‘Mind? He’d love it,’ said Charlotte.
‘Just go and say the three C.’s said I could
swim, and I can too!’</p>

<p>‘I can’t like that,’ said Rupert; ‘but if you
sent me with something, a book or anything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
then I could bring in swimming in a natural
sort of way and see what he said.’</p>

<p>‘Say we said was there any more of the
translated Latin book we could have. Will
that do? You know Latin, so that will be all
right. I say, I hope they haven’t gone without
us. They’re a most awful time. Look here,
cut off to Mr. Penfold’s before they come back,
if you like. I shall just say you’re gone. You
just <i>go</i>.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not a bad sort,’ said Rupert, thumping
her on the back as he went out, but keeping
his face carefully turned away; ‘I think I will.’</p>

<p>Charlotte and Charles met in the doorway,
and the meeting was rather violent, for both
were in a hurry—Charlotte to find out what
William had said and Charles to tell her. I am
sorry to say that he had not been washing his
hands, as indeed their colour plainly confessed,
but helping William in the toilet of the horse;
for Caroline had succeeded in persuading
William that to-day was, for all practical purposes,
the same as the other day, all the more
readily perhaps because Mrs. Wilmington had
come out and said that she didn’t think it was,
at all. And Caro had said she thought perhaps
they’d better <i>all</i> wash, and not just Charles.
And William said that he would drive them to
Lord Andore’s lodge gates, because he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
go down to the station to meet the Master anyhow,
and it was on the way, or next door to,
but they’d have to walk back. ‘And we’ve
forgotten to decide what flowers to get, and
Caro says bring up the books so that she can
look at them while you’re washing your hands.
Because William says he must start in a
quarter of an hour.’</p>

<p>Thus Charles ended breathlessly, adding,
‘Where’s Rupert?’</p>

<p>‘He’s not coming with us. Get down Pope
IV, and I’ll get the <i>Language Of</i>’; and carrying
the books she went up the wide shallow
stairs, three at once.</p>

<p>There was but little time to make a careful
selection of the flowers most likely to influence
a youthful peer. Charlotte was all for repeating,
flower for flower, the bouquet designed for
suitors, which had been so successfully used
in the case of Rupert and the Uncle. But
Caroline argued that what suited uncles might
very well be the worst possible thing for lords
who were no relations, and that it would be
much better to start afresh with an entirely
new floral selection.</p>

<p>‘Look in the <i>Language Of</i>, then, while I
wash,’ she said. ‘Look for duty and justice and
being kind to the poor.’ Charlotte fluttered
the pages obediently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Jealousy, Jest, Joy, Justice. Gladiolus and
sweet-scented tussilage. What’s tussilage?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Caroline, soaping
fervently; ‘try the medicine book.’ The
medicine book admitted that tussilage was
another name for <i>Tussilago Farfara</i>, or
coltsfoot.</p>

<p>‘But coltsfoot comes in February,’ said
Caroline, ‘and we don’t know it when it’s
grown up.’</p>

<p>‘There’s rudbeckia: justice,’ said Charlotte
hopefully. But the medicine book, when consulted,
pretended not to know anything at all
about rudbeckia, and as the children knew
nothing about it either, it was ruled out.</p>

<p>‘There’s justice shall be done, Cornflower,’
said Charlotte; and the medicine book, after
saying ‘See Bluebottle,’ informed them that
cornflowers ‘being naturally cold and dry are
under the dominion of Saturn’; also that
‘taken with water of plantain or the greater
comfrey is a remedy againſt the poiſon of the
ſcorpion.’</p>

<p>‘That’s all right,’ said Charlotte gaily; ‘it
must be sharper than a scorpion’s teeth to have
a wicked landlord. Now——’</p>

<p>‘I’ll look now,’ said Caroline; ‘you wash,
quick!’</p>

<p>Caroline chose red columbine because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
meant ‘anxious and trembling’; ‘and I’m sure
we shall be <i>that</i> soon enough,’ she said. The
medicine book confirmed her choice by assuring
her that columbine was an herb of Venus,
commonly used, with good success, for ‘ſore
mouths and throats.’</p>

<p>‘Ours will be, before we’ve done,’ she said.
‘We shall have to explain to him a lot.’</p>

<p>The liverwort polyanthus, though signifying
confidence, was rejected as being too
difficult to find most likely; but the daily rose
(‘Thy smile I aspire to’) seemed the very
thing, and it was agreed that lemon verbena
(‘Unexpected meeting’) would be both scented
and appropriate.</p>

<p>‘And I’ve got a little straw too,’ said
Caroline—‘I got it while William was harnessing—it
did so well with uncle; and wistaria
means ‘Welcome, fair stranger,’ so we’ll have
that. There was no time to look these up in
the medicine book, except liverwort, and of
this they had only to read that ‘It is true that
Mizaldus and others, yea, almoſt all aſtrological
phyſicians hold this to be an herb of Jupiter,
but the truth is it is an herb of Mercury, and a
ſingular good herb for all ſadness of ſpirit,’
when Charles came to say ‘Hurry up! or
William will be off without us.’</p>

<p>‘To gather the flowers will be but the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
of a moment,’ said Caroline; ‘you two go in
the carriage, and I’ll tell William to drive out
by the deserted lodge and pick me up at the
garden gate.’</p>

<p>Unfortunately the flowers were not easy to
find. The gardener had to be consulted, and
thus the gathering of Lord Andore’s presentation
bouquet was the work of about a quarter of
an hour, so that William was waiting and very
cross indeed when Caroline came running out
of the garden with the flowers—a mere bundle,
and no bouquet, as Charles told her—in her
held-up skirt.</p>

<p>‘No time now to drop people at the lodge
gates,’ he said. ‘I’ll set you down at the
turning, and even that I didn’t ought to do by
rights, being late as it is, and I shall have to
fan the horse along something cruel to get to
the station in time as it is.’</p>

<p>So the splendour of driving up to the castle
in the carriage was denied them; they could
not even drive to the lodge. And all they
got, after all Caroline’s careful diplomatic
treatment of William, was, as she said, ‘just a
bit of a lift.’</p>

<p>‘It saves time, though,’ said she, ‘and
time’s everything when you’ve got to be home
by half-past six. I do hope Lord Andore’s in,
don’t you?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know,’ said Charles. ‘I think it
would be more noble if we had to sacrifice
ourselves and go to London to see him. We
should have to break open our money-boxes.
I’ve always wanted to do that. I do wish
Rupert had been here. He could have made
up something to say in Latin, and then Lord
Andore would have had to pay attention.’</p>

<p>‘He’ll have to in English,’ said Caroline
quietly, ‘if he’s there. Oh, I do hope he is!
The Mineral woman is most likely crying all
this time. She only stopped for a minute, I’m
certain, to sort the bottles because of the man
coming for them with the cart at three. Won’t
it be glorious going and telling her that it’s all
right and she needn’t go?’</p>

<p>‘But suppose it all <i>isn’t</i>, and she <i>need</i>,’ said
Charles gloomily.</p>

<p>‘The spells have never failed us yet,’ said
Caroline.</p>

<p>‘I believe it’s something to do with the
garden and our being the ancestors of Dame
Eleanour,’ said Charlotte; ‘of course it’ll be
all right, Charles.’</p>

<p>‘Rupert didn’t think so.’</p>

<p>‘Rupert doesn’t know as much as we do,
when it isn’t Latin,’ said Charlotte. ‘We’re
going to teach Rupert a lot, by and by. You
see if we don’t. All right, William; we’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
getting out as fast as we can, aren’t we?’ for
the carriage had stopped, and a voice from the
box was urging them to look slippy.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled away, leaving them at
the corner, with the big bouquet which Caroline
had hastily arranged as they drove along.</p>

<p>‘If we see him, you’ll let me tell him, won’t
you?’ she said; ‘because the Mineral woman
told about it to me.’ And the others agreed,
though Charles pointed out that the Mineral
woman only told her because she happened to
be there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>THE APPEAL TO CÆSAR</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> far all had gone well with the project of
calling on Lord Andore to tell him about
his unfortunate tenant and the week-ending
admirers of her cottage. But at Lord Andore’s
lodge gate a check occurred.</p>

<p>As the long gate clicked itself into place
after they had passed through it, an elderly
person in a black cap with violet ribbons put
her head out of the lodge window and said:</p>

<p>‘No, you don’t!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we do,’ said Charlotte unguardedly.</p>

<p>‘No village children allowed in,’ said the
black and violet cap.</p>

<p>‘We aren’t,’ said Charles. And then the
cap disappeared only to reappear a moment
later at the lodge door, on the head of a very
angry old lady with a very sharp long nose,
who might have been Mrs. Wilmington’s
grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Out you go, the way you came,’ she said;
‘that’s the order. What do you want,
anyhow?’</p>

<p>‘We’ve got a bouquet for Lord Andore,’
said Caroline, showing it.</p>

<p>‘Keep it till the fifteenth,’ said the woman;
a silly thing to say, for no bouquet will keep a
fortnight. ‘No village people admitted till the
gala and fête when his lordship comes of age.
You can come then. Out you go. I’ve no
patience,’ she added; and it was quite plain
that she had not.</p>

<p>They had to go back. I wish I could
conceal from you that Charles put out his
tongue at her as he passed. It is a dreadful
thing to have to relate, and my only comfort
is that Caroline and Charlotte did not do it.
Charlotte made a face, but Caroline behaved
beautifully.</p>

<p>Only, when they were out in the road again,
it was Caroline who said, almost ‘between her
set teeth’ as heroes do in moments of crisis,
‘You know that broken paling we passed?’
The others instantly understood. They went
back, found the broken paling and slipped
through. It was Caroline’s dress that was
really badly torn. Charlotte’s was only gathers,
which you can tuck into your waistband and
it only makes a lump and the skirt rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a><br /><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a><br /><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
uneven lengths, and it was not the fence but
a nail that tore Charles’s stocking so badly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/i_272.jpg" width="385" height="592" alt="slipping through the fence" />
<div class="caption">Found the broken paling and slipped through.</div>
</div>

<p>The shrubbery in which they found themselves
was very thorny and undergrowthy,
and nearer to the lodge than they would have
chosen. They could see its white walls quite
plainly every now and then, and they feared
that it, or the managing director of it, might
be able to see them. But it makes all the
difference whether you are looking for a thing
or not, doesn’t it? And certainly the last
thing the cap woman expected was that any one
should dare to defy her.</p>

<p>So, undiscovered and unsuspected, the
children crept through the undergrowth. The
thorns and briars scratched at the blue muslins,
no longer, anyhow, in their first freshness, and
Charlotte’s white hat was snatched from her
head by a stout chestnut stump. The bouquet,
never the handsomest of its kind, was not
improved by its travels. But misfortunes such
as these occur to all tropical explorers, and
they pressed on. They were all very warm
and rather dirty when they emerged from
the undergrowth into the smooth spacious
park, and, beyond a belt of quiet trees, saw
the pale grey towers of the castle rise against
the sky. They looked back. The lodge was
not to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>‘So <i>that’s</i> all right,’ said Caroline. ‘Now
we must walk fast and yet not look as if we
were hurrying. I think it does that best if
you take very long steps. I wish we knew
where the front door was. It would be awful
if we went to the back one by mistake, and got
turned back by Lord Andore’s my-myrmidons.’</p>

<p>‘I expect his back door is grander than our
front,’ said Charlotte; ‘so we shan’t really
know till the myr-what’s-its-names have gone
for us.’</p>

<p>‘If we’d had time to disguise ourselves like
grown-ups—Char, for goodness’ sake tear that
strip off your hat, it looks like a petticoat’s
tape that’s coming down,’ said Caroline—‘they’d
have thought we’d come to call, with
cards, and then they’d have had to show us in,
unless he wasn’t at home.’</p>

<p>‘He must be at home,’ said Charlotte,
tearing a long streamer from the wretched
hat, which now looked less like a hat than a
fading flower that has been sat on; ‘it would
be too much if he wasn’t.’</p>

<p>They passed through the trees and on to
a very yellow gravelled drive, hot and gritty
to the foot, and distressing to the eye.
Following this, they came suddenly, round
a corner, on the castle. It was much bigger
than they expected, and there seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
no doubt which was the front entrance. Two
tall grey towers held a big arched gateway
between them, and the drive led straight in to
this. There seemed to be no door-bell and
no knocker, nor, as far as they could see, any
door.</p>

<p>‘I feel like Jack the Giant Killer,’ said
Charles; ‘only there isn’t a trumpet to blow.’</p>

<p>His voice, though he spoke almost in a
whisper, sounded loud and hollow under the
echoing arch of the gateway.</p>

<p>Beyond its cool depths was sunshine, with
grass and pink geraniums overflowing from
stone vases. A fountain in the middle leapt
and sank and plashed in a stone basin.</p>

<p>There was a door at the other side of the
courtyard—an arched door with steps leading
up to it. On the steps stood a footman.</p>

<p>‘He’s exactly like the one in <i>Alice</i>,’ said
Caroline; ‘courage and despatch.’</p>

<p>The footman looked curiously at the three
children, hot, dusty, and untidy, who advanced
through the trim parterre. His glance dwelt
more especially on the battered bouquet, on
Charlotte’s unspeakable hat, and the riven
stocking of Charles.</p>

<p>‘If you please,’ said Caroline, her heart
beating heavily, ‘we want to see Lord
Andore.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>‘’Slordship’s not at heum,’ said the footman,
looking down upon them.</p>

<p>‘When will he be back?’ Charlotte asked,
while Caroline suddenly wished that they had
at least brought their gloves.</p>

<p>‘Can’t say’m sheur,’ said the footman, doing
something to his teeth with a pin; and his tone
was wondrous like Mrs. Wilmington’s.</p>

<p>‘We want very much to see him,’ said
Charles. ‘You see we’ve brought him a
bouquet.’</p>

<p>‘I see you ’ave—have,’ said the footman,
more like Mrs. Wilmington than ever.
‘Would you like to leave it? It’ll be a surprise
for his Lordship when ’e comes in,’ and
the footman tittered.</p>

<p>‘He <i>is</i> here, then,’ said Caroline. ‘I mean,
he’s not in London?’</p>

<p>‘His Lordship is <i>not</i> in London,’ said the
footman. ‘Any other questions? Always
happy to say me catechism, ’m sheur.’</p>

<p>The children turned to go. They felt the
need of a private consultation.</p>

<p>‘Any particular neem?’ said the footman,
and tittered again. ‘’Slordship’ll be dying to
know who it was called,’ and once more he
tittered.</p>

<p>Charlotte turned suddenly and swiftly.</p>

<p>‘You need not trouble about our names,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
she said, ‘and I don’t believe Lord Andore
knows how you behave when he’s not there.
He doesn’t know <i>yet</i>, that is.’</p>

<p>‘No offence, Miss,’ said the footman very
quickly.</p>

<p>‘We accept your apology,’ said Charlotte;
‘and we shall wait till Lord Andore comes in.’</p>

<p>‘But, I say! Look here, you know’—the
footman came down one step in his earnestness—‘you
can’t wait here, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, we can,’ said Caroline, sitting
down on the second step. The others also
sat down. It was Charles who said, ‘So
there!’ and Caroline had to nudge him and
say, ‘Hush!’</p>

<p>‘We never called before at a house where
they didn’t ask you in and give you a chair
to sit on. But if this is that kind of house,’
said Charlotte grandly, ‘it does not matter.
It is a fine day, luckily.’</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said the footman behind them,
now thoroughly uneasy, ‘this won’t do, you
know. There’s company expected. I can’t
have a lot of ragged children sitting on the
steps like the First of May.’</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry,’ said Charlotte, without turning
her head; ‘but if you haven’t any rooms fit
to ask us into, I’m afraid you’ll <i>have</i> to have
us sitting here.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The three sat staring at the bright garden
and the dancing fountain.</p>

<p>‘Look here,’ said the footman, weakly
blustering; ‘this is cheek. That’s what this
is. But you go now. Do you hear? Or
must I make you?’</p>

<p>‘We hear,’ said Caroline, speaking as calmly
as one can speak when one is almost choking
with mingled rage, disappointment, fear, and
uncertainty.</p>

<p>‘And I defy you to lay a finger on your
master’s visitors,’ said Charlotte. ‘How do
you know who we are? We haven’t given
you our names.’</p>

<p>The footman must have felt a sudden doubt.
He hesitated a moment, and then, muttering
something about seeing Mr. Checkles, he
retired, leaving the children in possession of
the field. And there they sat, in a row, on
Lord Andore’s steps, with the bouquet laid
carefully on the step above them.</p>

<p>It was very silent there in the grey-walled
courtyard.</p>

<p>‘I say,’ whispered Charles, ‘let’s go.
We’ve got the better of <i>him</i>, anyhow. Let’s
do a bunk before he comes back with some one
we can’t get the better of, thousands of stately
butlers perhaps.’</p>

<p>‘Never,’ said Charlotte, whose hands were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
cold and trembling with excitement. But
Caroline said:</p>

<p>‘I wish Mr. Checkles might turn out to be
a gentleman, the everyday kind that we know.
Lords’ servants seem more common than
other people’s, and I expect the Lord’s something
like them. They say, Like master like
man.’</p>

<p>As if in answer to Caroline’s wish, a door
in the wall opened, showing a glimpse of more
garden beyond, and a jolly-faced youth came
towards them. He was a very big young
man, and his clothes, which were of dust-coloured
Harris tweed, were very loose. He
looked like a sixth-form boy, and Charles at
once felt that here was a man and a brother.
So he got up and went towards the new-comer
with the simple greeting, ‘Hullo!’</p>

<p>‘Hullo!’ said the sixth-form boy, with a
friendly and cheerful grin.</p>

<p>‘I say,’ said Charles confidentially, as he
and the big boy met on the grass, ‘there isn’t
really any reason why we shouldn’t wait here
if we want to?’</p>

<p>‘None in the world,’ said the big boy; ‘if
you’re sure that what you’re waiting for is
likely to come, and that this is the best place
to wait for it in.’</p>

<p>‘We’re waiting for Lord Andore,’ said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Caroline, who had picked up the bouquet and
advanced with it. ‘I’m so glad you’ve come,
because we don’t understand English menservants.
In India they behave differently
when you call.’</p>

<p>‘What have the servants here done?’ the
youth asked, frowning, with his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing,’ said Charles in a hurry; ‘at
least, I mean, we accepted his apologies, so we
can’t sneak.’</p>

<p>‘I wouldn’t call it sneaking to tell <i>you</i>,’ said
Caroline confidingly, ‘because, of course, you’d
promise on your honour not to tell Lord
Andore. We don’t want to get other people’s
servants into trouble when we’ve accepted
their apologies. But the footman <i>was</i>
rather——’</p>

<p>At this moment the footman himself
appeared at the top of the steps with an
elderly whiskered man in black, whom the
children rightly judged to be the butler. The
two had come hastily out of the door, but
when they saw the children and their companion,
the footman stopped as if, as Charles
said later, he had been turned to stone, and
only the butler advanced when the youth in
the Harris tweed said rather shortly, ‘Come
here, Checkles!’ Checkles came, quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
enough, and when he was quite close he
astonished the three C.’s much more than he
will astonish <i>you</i>, by saying, ‘Yes, m’lord!’</p>

<p>‘Tea on the terrace at once,’ said the
Harris-tweeded one, ‘and tell them not to be
all day about it.’</p>

<p>Checkles went, and the footman too.
Charlotte always believed that the last glance
he cast at her was not one of defiance but of
petition.</p>

<p>‘So you’re him,’ Charles was saying.
‘How jolly!’</p>

<p>But to Caroline it seemed that there was
no time to waste in personalities, however
flattering. Lord Andore’s tea was imminent.
He was most likely in a hurry for his tea; it
was past most people’s tea-time already. So
she suddenly held out the flowers, and said,
‘Here’s a bouquet. We made it for you.
Will you please take it.’</p>

<p>‘That’s awfully good of you, you know,’
said Lord Andore; ‘thanks no end!’ He
took the bouquet and smelt it, plunged his
nose into the midst of the columbine, roses,
cornflowers, lemon verbena, wistaria, gladiolus
and straw.</p>

<p>‘It’s not a very nice one, I’m afraid,’ said
Caroline; ‘but you can’t choose the nicest
flowers when you have to look them out in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
two books at once. It means Welcome, fair
stranger; An unexpected meeting; We are
anxious and trembling; Confidence—no, we left
that out, because we hadn’t any; and Agreement,
because we hope you will.’</p>

<p>‘How awfully interesting. It <i>was</i> kind of
you,’ said Lord Andore, and before he could
say any more Charlotte hastened to say:</p>

<p>‘You see, it’s not just an ordinary nosegay,
please, and don’t thank us, please, because it
wasn’t to please you but to serve our own
ends, though, of course, if we’d known how nice
you are, and if we’d thought you’d care about
one, we would have, in a minute.’</p>

<p>‘I see,’ said Lord Andore, quite as if he
really had seen.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure you don’t,’ said Caroline; ‘don’t
be polite, please. Say if you don’t understand.
What we want is justice. It’s one of your
tenants that had the cottage in your father’s
time before you, and they’re turning her out
because there are some week-endy people
think the cottage is so pretty, with the flowers
she planted, and the arbour her father made,
and the roses that came from her mother’s
brother in Cambridgeshire. And she said you
didn’t know. And we decided you ought to
know. So we made you the nosegay and we
came. And we ought to go, and here’s her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
name and address on a bit of paper, and I’m
sorry it’s only pencil. And you <i>will</i> see justice
done, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘It’s very kind of you,’ said Lord Andore
slowly, ‘to take so much interest in my
tenants.’</p>

<p>‘There,’ said Charlotte; ‘of course we were
afraid you’d say that. But we didn’t mean to
shove our oar in. We just went in for ginger-beer,
and Caro found her crying, and there’s a
hornbeam arbour, ever so old, and a few shillings
a week can’t make any difference to you,
with a lovely castle like this to live in. And
the motto on the tombs of your ancestors is
Flat Justicia. And it’s only bare justice we
want; and we saw the tomb on Sunday in
church, with the sons and daughters in ruffs.’</p>

<p>‘Stop!’ said Lord Andore. ‘I am only a
poor weak chap. I need my tea. Come and
have some too, and I’ll try to make out what
it’s all about.’</p>

<p>‘Thanks awfully,’ said the three C.’s, speaking
all together. And Caroline added, ‘We
mustn’t be long over tea, please, because we’ve
got to get home by half-past six, and it must
be nearly that now.’</p>

<p>‘You shall get back at half-past six all
right,’ said Lord Andore, and led the way, a
huge figure in the dust-coloured clothes, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the little door by which he had come, on to a
pleasant stone terrace with roses growing all
over and in and out and round about its fat old
balustrades.</p>

<p>‘Here’s tea,’ he said. And there it was,
set on a fair-sized table with a white cloth—a
tea worth waiting for. Honey and jam and all
sorts of cakes, and peaches and strawberries.
The footman was hovering about, but Charles
was the only one who seemed to see him. It
was bliss to Charles to see this proud enemy
humbly bearing an urn and lighting a spirit-lamp
to make the tea of those whom he had
tried to drive from even the lowly hospitality
of Lord Andore’s doorstep.</p>

<p>‘Come on,’ said the big sixth-form-looking
boy, who was Lord Andore; ‘you must be
starved. Cake first (and bread and butter
afterwards if you insist upon it) is the rule here.
Milk and sugar?’</p>

<p>They all drank tea much too strong for
them, out of respect to their host, who had
forgotten that when he was a little boy milk
was what one had at tea-time.</p>

<p>And slowly, by careful questioning, and by
making a sudden rule that no one was to say
more than thirty-seven words without stopping,
Lord Andore got at the whole story in a form
which he could understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I <i>see</i>,’ he would say, and ‘<i>I</i> see,’ and then
ask another question.</p>

<p>And at last when tea was really over, to the
last gladly accepted peach and the last sadly
unaccepted strawberry, he stood up and said:</p>

<p>‘If you don’t mind my saying so, I think
you are regular little bricks to have taken all
this trouble. And I am really and truly very
much obliged. Because I do mean to be just
and right to my tenants, only it’s very difficult
to know about things if nobody tells you. And
you’ve helped me a lot, and I thank you very
much.’</p>

<p>‘Then you will?’ said Charlotte breathlessly.</p>

<p>‘Not let her be turned out of her cottage,
she means,’ Caroline explained.</p>

<p>‘She means the Mineral woman,’ said
Charles.</p>

<p>‘Of course I won’t,’ said Lord Andore; ‘I
mean, of course, I will. I mean it’s all right.
And I’ll drive you home, and if you’re a minute
or two late, I’ll make it all right with uncle.’</p>

<p>The motor was waiting outside the great
arch that is held between the two great towers
of Andore Castle. It was a dream of a car,
and there was room for the three C.’s in front
beside the driver, who was Lord Andore
himself.</p>

<p>The footman was there, and the proudest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
moment of the day for Charles was that in
which Lord Andore gave the petition bouquet
into that footman’s care, and told him to see
that it was put in water, ‘Carefully, mind; and
tell them to put it on the dinner-table to-night.’</p>

<p>The footman said ‘Yes, m’lord,’ as though
he had never seen the bouquet before.
Charlotte’s proudest moment was when the
woman at the lodge gate had to curtsey
when the motor passed out.</p>

<p>Rupert was waiting for them at their own
lodge gate, and when he saw the motor, his
eyes grew quite round like pennies.</p>

<p>‘Oh, do stop, it’s Rupert,’ said the three
C.’s; and Rupert was bundled into the body
of the car, where he travelled in lonely
splendour. Yet, even after that, and when
the motor had gone away, and the three C.’s
had told him all their adventures and the
splendid success of their magic nosegay,
Rupert only said:</p>

<p>‘It’s Chance, I tell you. It’s just accidental.
Co—what’s its name—incidence. It would
all have happened just the same if you hadn’t
taken that hideous old mixed assorted haystack
with you.’</p>

<p>‘Still disagreeable?’ said Charlotte brightly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, been all the same, <i>would</i> it?’ said
Charles; ‘that’s all you know.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It’s <i>not</i> all I know,’ said Rupert; ‘as it
happens, I know heaps of things that you don’t.
And I could find out more if I wanted to. So
there!’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Rupert, don’t be cross,’ said Caroline,
‘just when we’re all so happy. I <i>do</i> wish you’d
been there, especially at tea-time.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not cross,’ said Rupert. ‘As it happens,
I was feeling extra jolly until you came home.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>don’t</i>,’ said Caroline; ‘do let’s call it
Pax. We haven’t told you half the little
interesting things that happened yet. And if
you can’t believe in the magic, it’s your misfortune.
We know you can’t help it. We
know you don’t unbelieve on purpose. We
know we’re right, and you think you know
you are.’</p>

<p>‘It’s the other way round,’ said Rupert, still
deep in gloom.</p>

<p>‘I <i>know</i> it is, when <i>you</i> think it, and when
we think it, it’s the other way,’ said Caroline.
‘Oh, Pax! Pax! Pax!’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ said Rupert. ‘I had a good
swim. Your Mr. Penfold’s not half a bad
sort. He taught me a new side-stroke.’ But
it was plain that Rupert’s inside self still felt
cloudy and far from comfortable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next day the three C.’s and Rupert, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
middle of Irish stew, were surprised by the
sudden rustling entrance of Mrs. Wilmington.</p>

<p>‘A person wishes to see you,’ she said to
Caroline; ‘quite a poor person. I asked her
to wait till dinner was completed; but she
says that she hopes you will see her now, as
she ought to commence going home almost
at once.’</p>

<p>‘Of course!’ said Caroline; ‘it must be
the Mineral woman.’</p>

<p>‘She seemed to me,’ said Mrs. Wilmington,
‘to have an animal face.’</p>

<p>But Caroline was already in the hall, and
the figure that rose politely from the oak chair
was plainly—though disguised in her Sunday
clothes—that of the Mineral woman.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Miss!’ she said; ‘oh, Miss!’ She
took hold of both Caroline’s hands and shook
them, but that was not enough. Caroline
found herself kissed on both cheeks, and then
suddenly hugged; and ‘Oh, Miss!’ the
Mineral woman said; ‘oh, Miss!’ And then
she felt for her handkerchief in a black bag
she carried, and blew her nose loudly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington had gone through the
hall very slowly indeed; but even she could
not go slowly enough not to be gone by the
time the Mineral woman had, for the time
being, finished with her nose. And as Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
Wilmington went through the baize door,
she heard again, ‘Oh, Miss!’</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington came back five minutes
later, and this time she heard:</p>

<p>‘And it’s all right, Miss; and two bright
new five-pound notes “to buy more rose trees
with,” and a letter in his own write of hand
thanking us for making the place so pretty;
and I’m to be tenant for life, Miss. And it’s
all your doing, bless your kind heart. So I
came to tell you. I never thought I should
feel like I do about any strange little gell. It
was all your doing, Miss, my dear.’</p>

<p>Which was a very mysterious and exciting
thing to be overheard by any housekeeper
who was not in the secret. And a very heartwarming
and pleasant thing to be listened to
by a little girl who was.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ said Caroline, when she had
told the others of the Mineral woman’s
happiness, ‘the magic always works.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE LE-O-PARD</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">We</span> simply must write to Aunt Emmeline,’
said Caroline earnestly. ‘I’ve got three new
pens and some scented violet ink. I got it at
the shop yesterday; it’s lovely. And I’ve been
counting up the picture post-cards she and
Uncle Percival have sent us. There are forty-two,
and twenty-eight of those have come
since we wrote last.’</p>

<p>‘I’d almost rather not have the post-cards;
they make you feel so horrid when you don’t
write,’ said Charles. ‘Suppose <i>we</i> send picture
post-cards. You don’t have to write nearly so
much.’</p>

<p>I think that would be shirking,’ said
Charlotte, who did not want to go out, and
more than half believed what she said. ‘Come
on. If we must, we must. Necessity doesn’t
know the law.’</p>

<p>‘You write, too, Rupert,’ said Charle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>s
kindly. ‘Put some Latin in. They’ll love
that. Or perhaps you’d tell me some to say.
I can put it in if you say how I ought to
spell it.’</p>

<p>But Rupert said he couldn’t be bothered,
and took down a book—Jesse’s <i>Anecdotes of
Dogs</i> it was, with alluring pictures and delightful
stories; but he did not really read it.</p>

<p>Caroline, looking up in an agony of ignorance
as to the way you spelt assafœtida,
which the medicine book said was good for
‘pains in the head brought about by much
ſtudy of the printed book,’ saw that Rupert’s
eyes were fixed in a dismal stare on the
portrait above the mantelpiece, the portrait of
Dame Eleanour.</p>

<p>He was looking at it as though he did not
see it, and yet Charlotte could not help saying,
‘Isn’t she splendid? <i>She</i> knew all about
spells and things. It’s her books we do it
out of—at least, most of it.’</p>

<p>‘If she knew all about them, she knew
what rotten rot they were,’ said Rupert. ‘You
never try to do anything with your spells
except the things that would happen just the
same without your spelling.’</p>

<p>‘What’s that about my spelling?’ asked
Caroline, who had made a bold dash for what
she remembered of the way the word looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in the medicine book, and written, in a violent
violet smudge, ‘Aſſerphrodite.’</p>

<p>‘I say your magic isn’t real.’</p>

<p>‘We saw you when you were invisible,’
Caroline began, laying down her pen, whose
wet nib at once tried to dry, turning from
purple to golden green bronze. And then:</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know,’ said Rupert; ‘but if it’s
really real, why don’t you do something with
it that can’t really happen <i>in puris naturalatibus?</i>—that
means just naturally. Why
don’t you bring back Mrs. Wilmington’s cat
that’s lost? Or find my Kohinore pencil.
Then there’s a thing in that book Mr. Penfold’s
got. He told me about it. You make a wax
image of your enemy and stick pins into it,
and every time you stick in a pin your enemy
feels a pain in the part you stick the pins into.’</p>

<p>‘How awfully wicked!’ said Caroline in an
awe-struck voice.</p>

<p>‘Or you can roast the wax man in front of
a fire, and as the wax melts, the man wastes
away,’ said Rupert hardly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>don’t!</i>’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Yes, do,’ said Charles; ‘what else?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, nothing else. It’s better if you get a
bit of the enemy’s hair, and put that on your
wax man’s head. Mr. Penfold read me bits
out of a piece of poetry about it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Didn’t he say it was wicked?’ Caroline
asked.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Rupert reluctantly; ‘but I know
what’s wicked without Mr. Penfold telling me,
or you either. Just fancy how your enemy
would squirm when he felt the pin-pricks;
they’d be like sword-thrusts, you know, to him.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t!’ said Caroline; ‘don’t, Rupert, it’s
horrid. Please don’t. I don’t want to know
about those sort of spells.’</p>

<p>‘Rupert wouldn’t do it, of course,’ said
Charles. ‘He’s only talking.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know I wouldn’t?’ said
Rupert savagely. ‘Next time you have a pain
in your leg, Caroline, you’ll think it’s growing
pains, but really it’ll be me, sticking a long hat-pin
into the wax image I’ve secretly made of
you.’</p>

<p>Caroline got up.</p>

<p>‘Come, Char,’ she said, ‘we’ll go and sit in
the drawing-room if Rupert’s going on like
this.’</p>

<p>‘He doesn’t mean it,’ said Charles again.</p>

<p>‘Of course I don’t,’ said Rupert, and
suddenly smiled. ‘I don’t know why I said it.
Don’t be silly. There’s lots of things you
could try, though, and not hurt any one. Why
don’t you——?’ He looked vaguely round
the room, and his eyes lighted once more on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the portrait. ‘Why don’t you make <i>that</i> come
to life? If she was a witch, her picture ought
to be good for that, anyhow.’</p>

<p>‘I wish we could,’ said all the children together,
with deep earnestness.</p>

<p>‘Well, do it then,’ said Rupert. ‘That’s the
sort of thing to make me believe, not the
duffing things you’ve kept on doing ever since
I’ve been here.’</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then, ‘How do you
spell “impossible”?’ asked Charles, and then
nothing more was heard but the scratching of
violet pens.</p>

<p>But from that time, and in between all other
thoughts and happenings, Charlotte kept on
thinking about that idea. If only the picture
could be made to come alive!</p>

<p>And Charles’s fancy played timidly with the
idea of the wax man. Not to hurt the person
it was like, of course, but just to see if anything
happened. Not pins. But just pinching its
foot a very very very little, secretly, with the
image in your pocket, when the person it was
the image of was there, just to see if the person
jumped or called out, as you do if you’re suddenly
pinched, no matter how gently.</p>

<p>Charlotte’s mind busied itself then and later,
in and between other thoughts, with the question
of what was the matter with Rupert, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
whether something couldn’t be done to help
him.</p>

<p>For there was no doubt of it. Rupert
wasn’t at all what they had first thought him.
Sometimes, it is true, he would be as jolly as
you need wish a boy to be. He would start
new games and play them in the most amusing
and satisfactory way. But always, sooner or
later, and generally sooner, the light of life
seemed to go out of him, and he would seem
suddenly to be not only tired of the game but
tired of everything else, and not only tired of
everything, but angry with everybody.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure he’s bewitched,’ said Charlotte
more than once in those intimate moments
when Caroline and she ‘talked things over’ as
they brushed their hair. ‘I shouldn’t wonder
if somebody’s made a wax image of <i>him</i>, and
it’s when they stick the pins in it that he goes
all savage all in a minute.’</p>

<p>‘I do think <i>that’s</i> nonsense,’ Caroline always
said. ‘I’m sure it wouldn’t be allowed.’</p>

<p>‘How would you make an image of a
person’s mind?’ Charlotte woke Caroline up
to ask, one night; and when Caroline with
sleepy sharpness said, ‘You can’t; go to
sleep, do,’ Charlotte answered, ‘I believe you
can; there was something written under somebody’s
portrait in history, about painting hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>s
mind; and if you can paint a mind, you can
make a wax image of it. I believe that’s what
somebody’s done to Rupert, don’t you? And
stuck knives into it? Oh, well, if you <i>will</i> go
to sleep!’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>Rupert grew grumpier and grumpier as the
days went on, and seemed to care less and less
for being with the three C.’s. He would go for
long walks by himself, and seemed to prefer to
be with William, who ‘put up’ with him, or
even with Mrs. Wilmington, who adored him,
to being with the children.</p>

<p>‘And we thought it would be so jolly,’
sighed Charlotte; ‘and the worst of it is
Charles tries to imitate him. He speaks quite
rudely sometimes, even to you, Caro, and you
know he always used to like you best.’</p>

<p>The only thing Rupert seemed truly and
constantly to care for was swimming. He
went down to the river with Mr. Penfold
almost every day, or met him at the bathing-place,
and they swam together. With Mr.
Penfold, Rupert was nearly always at his best,
perhaps because Mr. Penfold never seemed to
notice it when he wasn’t.</p>

<p>The village was growing more and more
busy and excited as the day drew near when
Lord Andore’s coming of age was to be celebrated
by what the people called a Grangaileranfeat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
This was to be held in Lord Andore’s
park and in certain meadows adjoining; there
were to be roundabouts and cocoanut-shies and
shooting-galleries, and a real circus, with a
menagerie and performing elephants and educated
seals,—all free. The children looked
forward longingly to the day. Lord Andore
had sent them cards with his mother’s name
and his on them in print, and the name of each
child in writing, requesting the pleasure of their
company on the occasion of Lord Andore’s
twenty-first birthday. And they had joyously,
and with much violet ink, accepted. And the
day came nearer and nearer. It did not seem
worth while to engage in any new magic while
there was this real pleasure to look forward to.</p>

<p>And then, the very day before <i>the</i> day, when
the roundabouts had arrived and been set up,
and the menagerie was howling invitingly in
its appointed field, the cup of joy was dashed,
as Charlotte said, into little bits. Lady Andore
slipped on an orange pip and broke her
ankle, and the festivities were postponed until
September. So said a card brought by
the very footman who had not known their
names.</p>

<p>‘He jolly well knows them now,’ said
Charles. It was his only comfort.</p>

<p>‘There’s many a pip ’twixt the cup and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
lip,’ said Charlotte; and Caroline said, ‘Oh,
bother!’</p>

<p>Rupert said nothing. He had been invited
too, of course, and had, at moments, seemed
pleased. Now he just took his cap and went
out, and came home late for tea. The three
C.’s learned with feelings of distress, mingled
with anger, that Rupert had been to the
menagerie by himself, and had seen all the
beasts, and that he had also witnessed a performance
of the circus people, which they had
thought it worth while to give to such of the
villagers as cared to pay for their amusements.
He had seen everything, from the accomplished
elephants to the educated seals.</p>

<p>‘You might have told us you were going,’
said Charles.</p>

<p>‘You could have gone if you’d wanted to,’
said Rupert.</p>

<p>‘Never mind, Charles,’ said Caroline;
‘we’ll ask the Uncle to take us to-morrow.’</p>

<p>‘They’re off to-morrow,’ said Rupert;
‘that’s why I went to-day.’ He added something
bitter and almost unbearable about a
parcel of kids.</p>

<p>But the circus, as it turned out, was not off
next day. An accident had happened. Something
was missing, and the circus could not
go on its travels till that something was found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t know what it is,’ said Harriet, when
she told them about it at breakfast; ‘but
they’ve lost something they set store by.
Some says it’s an improving seal, and others
says it’s a boar-conjector-snake, and Poad told
my gentleman friend it was the white-eyed
Kaffir made a bolt for freedom and India’s
coral strand, where he was stole from when a
babe; but I don’t know the rights of it. They
sent for Poad. My gentleman friend’ll know
all about it next time I see him.’</p>

<p>‘When shall you see him again?’ Charles
asked.</p>

<p>‘I can see him whenever I’ve a mind,’ said
Harriet proudly. ‘I’m not one of those as
has to run after their gentlemen friends.’</p>

<p>‘I do wonder what it is,’ Charlotte said.
‘Do see your friend as soon as you can and
ask him, won’t you, Harriet? I do hope it’s
not snakes or bears. You’ll be sure to tell
us directly you know, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Sure,’ said Harriet.</p>

<p>It was from William, however, that they
heard what it was that the circus had really
lost.</p>

<p>‘It’s a tame Le-o-pard,’ said William; ‘him
with the spots that you can’t change, and the
long tail.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Charlotte; ‘there’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
leopard’s skin in the drawing-room. Very
spotty they are. And fierce, too, I believe.
Oh, William! I do hope it won’t come this
way.’</p>

<p>‘There’s something about it in the book,’
said Caroline, who, as usual, had her magic
books under her arm. She found the place
and read, ‘Leopard’s-bane, its government and
virtues’—quite a long piece. When she had
done, William said:</p>

<p>‘Thank you very much; quite pretty, ain’t
it?’ And Rupert said it was all nonsense.</p>

<p>‘But it <i>won’t</i> come this way, will it?’
Charlotte repeated.</p>

<p>‘It’s a tame one,’ said William, grinning.
‘At least that’s the character it’s got from its
last place. But it won’t be any too tame for
Poad, I expect. I hear he’s got the job of
catching of it. And serve him right too.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, why?’ asked Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Because,’ said William shortly, and was
told not to be cross about nothing.</p>

<p>‘’Tain’t nothing, then,’ he said; ‘’twas the
way he acted about my dog license, and the
dog only two months over puppy-age, when
no license is taken nor yet asked.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t fancy Poad much myself,’ said
Rupert; ‘he needn’t have been so keen about
catching me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Now that’s where you’re wrong,’ said
William. ‘Hunting of you, that was no more
than Poad’s duty; and if he set about it like
a jackape, well, some is born silly and can’t
help it, and why blame the man? But the
dog, ’e worn’t Poad’s duty. He exceeded
about the dog, Poad did, and I don’t bear
malice; but I’ll be even with him yet about
that dog.’</p>

<p>‘How?’ asked Rupert.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I’ll find a way,’ said William carelessly.
‘No hurry. Acts like that act what
Poad did about my Pincher, they always come
home to roost—them acts do. Now then, Miss
Charlotte, leave that saddle soap alone, and
get along into the garden. The gates ’as
been locked since eight this morning, and
you’re to go through the secret way to-day,
and not to go outside the garden because of
that old speckled Le-o-pard.’</p>

<p>The three C.’s went, but Rupert lingered
beside William, fingering the bright buckles
of the harness and passing the smooth reins
slowly through his fingers.</p>

<p>For some time the three C.’s were very
busy in the garden, gathering heart-shaped
green leaves and golden fragile daisy-like
flowers.</p>

<p>‘I never thought,’ said Caroline earnestly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
opening the brown book and sitting down on
the terrace steps with a sheaf of green and
yellow beside her, ‘that we should need it when
I read about it in the <i>Language Of</i>, and in the
medicine book. Look here, it says: “It is
under Apollo, and the flowers and leaves
thereof all leopards and their kind do fear and
abhor. Wherefore if it be ſtrewn in the paths
theſe fearful beaſts do frequent, they may not
paſs, but ſhall turn again and go each to his own
place in all meekneſs and ſubmiſsion. Indeed,
it hath been held by the ancients, aye and
by philoſophers of our own times, that in this
herb lieth a charm to turn to water the hearts
of theſe furious ſpotted great cats, and to looſe
the ſtrings of their tongues, ſo that they ſpeak
in the ſpeech of men, uttering ſtrange things
and very wondrous. But of this the author
cannot ſpeak certainly, ſince the Leopard is not
native to this land unleſs it be in Northumberland
and Wales where all wild things might
well be hidden.”’</p>

<p>‘So, you see,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>But Charlotte said it was all very well, only
how were they to get the bane to the leopard?</p>

<p>‘It isn’t as if we were allowed free,’ she
pointed out. ‘I wish they hadn’t been so
careful. The leopard would never have hurt
us as long as we carried the bane, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
could have surrounded it, like snakes, with ash
leaves, and it would have had to surrender.’</p>

<p>‘And perhaps it would have talked to us
and followed us like tame fawns,’ suggested
Charlotte; ‘or Una; only hers was a lion.’</p>

<p>‘Nonsense!’ said Charles; ‘you know you’d
have been afraid.’</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘You would,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘You would.’</p>

<p>‘I shouldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘You would.’</p>

<p>‘And now you’re both exactly like Rupert,’
said Caroline; ‘and the leopard wandering
about unbaned while you’re wrangling. You’re
like Nero and Rome.’</p>

<p>Twenty minutes had passed before peace
was restored, and the leopard’s-bane lay drooping
in the sun, the delicate gold and green
heaps of it growing flatter and flatter.</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Charles suddenly, ‘if
you’re not afraid, let’s go. No one’s forbidden
us to, except William.’</p>

<p>‘I will if you will,’ said Charlotte, turning
red.</p>

<p>‘So will I,’ said Caroline, turning pale.</p>

<p>‘Rupert said it was nonsense about the
leopard’s-bane when you read it this morning.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>‘That doesn’t make it nonsense,’ said
Charlotte sharply.</p>

<p>‘But suppose you meet it?’</p>

<p>‘You can’t—if you keep to the road.
Leopards get into trees. They never walk
about in roads like elephants do. Not even
when the circus man is moving. It’s serious
what we’re going to do,’ said Caroline; ‘and
what’ll people say about it, depends how it
turns out. If we parrylise the leopard and
save the village, we shall be heroines like——’</p>

<p>(‘And heroes,’ said Charles.)</p>

<p>‘Like Joan of Arc, and Philippa who sucked
the poison out of the burgesses’ keys at Calais.’</p>

<p>‘And if we don’t put the stuff in the right
place, or the leopard doesn’t take any notice of
it, they’ll just say we were disobedient.’</p>

<p>‘And suppose we meet the leopard face to
face?’</p>

<p>‘It’s a <i>tame</i> leopard,’ said Caroline in a
faltering voice.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t want to go. I really am
frightened. I don’t mind owning up. I am.
I’m so frightened I think we ought to go. I
don’t want to so dreadfully, that I’m sure it’s
right for me to go. But I wish you and
Charles would stay here. Suppose the leopard
came over the wall and there was no one here
to cope with it?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>She was very pale and she trembled. And
when the others, without hesitation, said, ‘Not
much, we don’t!’ she certainly breathed more
easily.</p>

<p>‘Come on, then,’ she said. ‘We’ll strew a
little here because of the gardeners. Oh no,
of course the roots will make it all safe here.
The gate’s locked; we must go through the
secret passage and then creep through the
stable-yard and out along the garden wall, so
that the Wilmington doesn’t see us. And
then out by the deserted lodge.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE LEOPARD’S-BANE</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Their</span> minds once made up, the children
collected the fading armfuls of leopard’s-bane
and made for the arbour that led to the tunnel.
Inside the door they lighted the candle, closed
and bolted the door as they had been told to,
and went carefully down the steps and along the
secret passage. And as they went they heard
something moving in the darkness that lay thick
beyond the little wavering light of their candle.</p>

<p>They stopped and listened. They heard the
sound of breathing, and the next moment they
saw, vaguely, in the almost darkness, something
four-footed, spotted, furry, creeping along the
passage towards them. It uttered a low, fierce,
snarling growl.</p>

<p>‘Throw it down,’ said Caroline, casting
her flowers from her. ‘It can’t pass it. It
can’t.’</p>

<p>A heap of tangled crushed leaves and flower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a><br /><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a><br /><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>s
was all that there was now between the children
and the leopard.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 387px;">
<img src="images/i_310.jpg" width="387" height="597" alt="meeting leopard in dark tunnel" />
<div class="caption">Something four-footed, spotted, furry, creeping along the passage.</div>
</div>

<p>‘It can’t pass it. It can’t,’ said Caroline
again, in an agonised whisper. Yet none of
the children dared to turn and fly. Charlotte
had remembered what she had heard of quelling
wild animals by the power of the human eye,
and was trying, almost without knowing that
she tried, to meet the eye of this one. But
she could not. It held its head down close to
the ground and kept quite still. Every one
felt it was impossible to turn their backs on the
creature. Better to face it. If they turned
and ran, well, the door at the end of the passage
was bolted; and if the flower-spell should fail,
then, the moment their backs were turned, the
leopard might—with one spring——</p>

<p>‘Oh, I wish we hadn’t,’ said Charles, and
burst into tears.</p>

<p>‘Don’t, oh, don’t!’ said Caroline; and to
the leopard, who had not moved, she said, with
wild courage:</p>

<p>‘Down, sir! Lie down!’</p>

<p>The leopard lay down, flat—flatter than you
would think a leopard <i>could</i> lie.</p>

<p>‘It understands,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes.’ Caroline’s voice trembled as
much as the hand that held the candlestick.
‘It does. Poor Pussy! Poor Leopard, then.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>A faint rumbling sound came from the
crouching heap of spotted fur.</p>

<p>‘I believe it’s trying to purr,’ whispered
Caroline. ‘Of course leopards’ purrs <i>would</i> be
different.’</p>

<p>‘Give a paw, then,’ she said very shakily.
And the leopard lifted a ragged-looking forefoot.
But even Caroline had not the courage
to reach out a hand towards it.</p>

<p>‘Go to sleep, good dog, then,’ she said in a
distracted whisper. ‘Go to sleep, go by-by,
good little leopard, then.’</p>

<p>The leopard curled up and lay quite still.</p>

<p>‘It’s all right, I tell you,’ said Caroline.
‘Stop snivelling, Charles. I knew the leopard’s-bane
would do it. Now let’s go back backwards,
very slowly, and if it moves, I’ll speak
to it again.’</p>

<p>Very slowly, still striving to keep their eyes
on the leopard, they retreated. They had not
gone three steps before they heard it move.
They stopped.</p>

<p>‘Lie down!’ said Caroline. And then, to
their mingled horror, wonder, delight, surprise,
dismay, and satisfaction, a voice answered
them—a curious, choked, husky voice.</p>

<p>‘Leopard stay still,’ it answered; ‘little lady
not be frightened. Leopard like flowers.
Leopard quite good.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Is it?’ said Caroline, speaking as well as
she could through the beating of her heart.
‘Is it the leopard speaking?’</p>

<p>‘Ess, little missy,’ said the choked voice.
‘Pretty flowers loose leopard’s tonguey, make
him talky. Leopard tell a secret. Little
ladies sow seeds, pinky seeds, hearty seeds, the
right day, the right way, and see what come
up. Run way now. Leopard done talky. He
go sleepy by-by. So long!’</p>

<p>None of them ever knew how they got to
the end of the tunnel, got the bolts undone, got
the door shut again, and stood in the dusky
arbour looking in each other’s paper-white faces.</p>

<p>Charlotte made two steps into the sunlight
and threw herself face downwards on the path.
Her shoulders heaved. Charles was still
weeping without moderation or concealment.
Caroline stood shivering in the sunshine.</p>

<p>‘But we’ve got to get back,’ she said. ‘It’s all
right this side, because of the leopard’s-bane.
But if somebody came behind the leopard’s-bane,
from the house, you know? We must
climb the wall and get to the house and warn
them. Get up, Char. Charles, if you’re ever
going to be a man, be one now. There’ll be
plenty of time to howl when it’s all over. We
must climb the wall, somehow.’</p>

<p>One leaves the children in the garden, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
locked door between them and the leopard,
trying to find a way of climbing a ten-foot wall.
No gardener was to be found and the gates
were locked.</p>

<p>‘We must get over,’ Caroline kept saying.
‘Oh, we must, we must! The charm worked
perfectly. If we can only get to the other end
of the tunnel and throw in some more bane we
shall have done the great deed. Try again,
Charles. I’ll give you a leg up. We <i>must</i> get
over. Try again.’</p>

<p>One leaves Charles trying.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now although the three C.’s firmly believed
that the magic of the green and yellow flowers
subdued the leopard and caused it to speak—in
a sort of language that somehow recalled the
far-off speech of their ayah in India—I cannot
quite expect you to believe this. And I feel
that I must delay no longer to tell you what it
is you <i>can</i> believe. To do this we must go
back to Rupert, whom we left with William in
the harness-room, fingering the bright buckles
and drawing the long smooth reins through his
fingers.</p>

<p>‘I say, William,’ he said, ‘couldn’t we play a
little trick on that Poad? There’s a leopard
skin in the drawing-room. If I got a couple of
pillows and a needle and thread?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Eh?’ said William, staring at him. Then
suddenly he smacked his leg and laughed
aloud. ‘You’ve hit it this time, Master
Rupert,’ he said; ‘blessed if you ’aven’t.
You go along in and get the skin. Careful
now, because of Mother Wilmington.’</p>

<p>‘The drawing-room’s locked,’ said Rupert,
‘and I don’t want to tell the others.’</p>

<p>‘The drawing-room windows isn’t,’ said
William. ‘We’ll watch our time, and I’ll make
a back for you. An’ never you mind about
pillows. Straw’s good enough stuffing. An’
don’t forget the needle and cotton. I expect
you’ll find some lady’s working-box in the
drawing-room to get <i>them</i> out of.’</p>

<p>Rupert, once safely landed in the drawing-room,
found the leopard skin easily enough,
but the needle and cotton were not so easily
found. He found a work-table indeed, made
of satinwood, inlaid with ivory and lined with
faded red velvet, where were reels of silk and
flat ivory winders with thread on them, but
all the needles were red with rust, and fast
embedded in their cushions and cases. He
looked round. None of the cabinets looked
as though they held needles. And besides,
what was the use of finding more rusty
needles? One rusty needle was as useful,
or rather as useless, as fifty could be. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
thought of using the blind-cords instead of
cotton, but they were too thick, and one could
not push them through the leopard skin without
tearing it. Then he saw the golden quiet
harp standing in its far corner. Its strings
perhaps? But he did not know how to unstring
a harp, and when he touched one of its
fine wires, just the thing for sewing with
without a needle, it gave out the thin sweet
ghost of a note of music, faint indeed, but
loud enough to warn him of the cry it could
and would give if he attempted violence. The
harp quivered under his hands as he gently
let the string go, and something rattled. It
was the lid of a sort of box in the pedestal
of the harp.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps they kept spare strings there,’
Rupert thought, and opened the lid.</p>

<p>‘They,’ it seemed, had kept spare strings
here, and here the spare strings still lay, coiled
neatly in little round boxes. Rupert opened
several, and choosing the thinner strings, put
them in his pocket. One box rattled dryly in
his hand, and when he opened it there were
no strings, only a number of odd, flat, pinkish
heart-shaped seeds. On the box was written,
‘Seed of the F. of H.D. Sow only in the
way and on the day.’</p>

<p>He put its lid on and thought, then, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
more of the box. But afterwards he remembered
it.</p>

<p>And now, with the leopard’s skin in his
arms and the wires in his pockets, Rupert
went cautiously to the window. Yes, all was
safe; so William’s signal told him. He
dropped the bright skin into William’s hands,
and himself dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>‘I’ve thought of something better than
straw,’ he said, when he and William and the
leopard skin were alone together in the
harness-room. And William, when the new
thought was explained to him, slapped his
leg harder, and laughed more thoroughly than
before.</p>

<p>Rupert had only just entered the secret
passage, his first match had just gone out,
when he heard the children at the other end.
He went towards them, fully meaning to
explain what sort of leopard he was, and what
sort of joke—he called it a joke to himself—he
and William had arranged to play upon
Poad. But when he heard them speak, and
saw the showers of leopard’s-bane fall on the
flags of the passage, he, as he put it later,
‘played up.’ And when the children had
gone, he laughed softly to himself and began
to think what would be the best spot in the
tunnel to wait for Poad in. He had noticed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
by the light of that first match, an arched
recess, the one, you remember, where the
children stored their sacks of wet rose leaves
the night they played at Rosicurians and
cured Rupert. He would hide in this, and
then, when Poad came along, he would jump
out at him with that snarl which had sounded
so well when he met the children.</p>

<p>He waited till the garden door was locked,
and then felt for his matches. He could not
find them. He must have dropped them
when he was pretending to the children. He
felt along the floor, but there were no matches
to be found. Never mind, he could feel his
way in the dark. He knew exactly where the
arch was. To the left, about three-quarters
of the way down the passage. He stood up
and laid his hand upon the wall, walked
forward till he felt the corner of the recess,
and stooped to curl himself up in it and wait
for Poad. He put his hand out to steady
himself as he sat down, and his hand touched,
not the stone floor, but soft warm fur. And
not dry hard fur like that which he himself
wore, sewn tightly round him with harp-strings,
but living fur, on a living creature.
He drew back his hand, and a cold sweat of
horror broke out on his forehead, and the
little hairs on the back of his neck seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
to move by themselves. His hand still felt
the dreadful warm softness of that fur. It
almost seemed to him that he had felt the
spots on it.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I wish I hadn’t!’ said Rupert to
himself, as so many of us have said when it
was too late to say anything. ‘Oh, I <i>wish</i> I
hadn’t!’</p>

<p>He stood perfectly still in the mockery of
his sewn-on leopard skin, waiting for the real
leopard to move, or to settle down. Perhaps
it would settle down? The leopard must
have crept in when the door into the garden
was opened in readiness for the children to
pass through. It must have gone to sleep
there, and perhaps he had not roused it.</p>

<p>‘Oh, why didn’t I go with the others?’
Rupert thought. And then a good thought
came to him.</p>

<p>‘If I had,’ he told himself, ‘I should have
been out there, and they wouldn’t have met
me and turned back, and then they might
have found the real leopard, and it might have
jumped on them. I’m glad it’s only me.’</p>

<p>This good thought came to him as he rose
up and steadied himself by the wall. Then
in an instant all thoughts were drowned in
a flood of terror, and Rupert found himself
almost running, feeling his way by the wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
towards the house entrance. If he could only
get out before the leopard was up and after
him! He reached the end of the passage.
The door at the foot of the stairs was shut
and locked. He was alone there in the dark
with a locked door at each end of the passage.
He crouched down by the door. In spite of
his agony of fear he had enough sense not
to beat on the door and scream for help, which
was, of course, his first mad impulse.</p>

<p>‘Keep quiet,’ he kept telling himself, ‘some
one <i>must</i> come soon. If you keep quiet, the
leopard will go on sleeping, perhaps. The
children will open the garden door when they
hear the dinner-bell. Then you can get out.
If you make a row, the leopard will wake up
and come for you.’</p>

<p>So he crouched and waited. But no one
came. Then suddenly he remembered. When
the children heard the dinner-bell they would
come down the passage. They would find
the real leopard. It would certainly wake.
His own feelings about the leopard now made
him certain that the children, when they were
safe in the sunshine, would see that what
talked to them, dressed in a leopard’s skin,
<i>could</i> only have been a human being dressed
up. Most likely they knew already who it
was. So they would come back without fear—come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
back to find him, Rupert, and would
find <i>that!</i></p>

<p>Then Rupert did what was really an heroic
thing. He stood up, and, as quickly as he
could, began to feel his way back along the side
of the passage farthest from the arched recess.
He would go to the garden door, and when the
children opened it, he could prevent their coming
in. To do this he must pass the leopard.</p>

<p>A warm delicious glow stole through him.
This was worth it. Better than crouching
like a coward at the far side and letting those
children come laughing and talking down the
passage to meet <i>that</i>, savage from a sudden
awakening. He took off his boots, and crept
quietly along. No sound broke the black
silence. He reached the flight of steps,
reached the other door, sat down on the top
step and waited.</p>

<p>Nothing had stirred in the silence.</p>

<p>‘Anyhow,’ said Rupert, ‘I feel safer at the
top of the stairs than at the bottom.’</p>

<p>Rupert will never know how long he sat
there in the darkness. The cracks in the
door which showed as pale vertical streaks
were his only comfort. He tried to get off
the leopard’s skin, but the harp-strings were
too strong. It seemed to him that he had
been there a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>There were voices, many voices, Charlotte’s
voice high above the others. Rupert hoped
the leopard was too far away to hear, but how
could he know where the leopard was? It
might have crept quite close to him on its
padded noiseless feet, and he would never
have known. It might be within a yard of
him now.</p>

<p>Rupert understood in that hour what sort
of practical joke it was that he had prepared
for the policeman.</p>

<p>‘Because, of course,’ said Rupert, ‘I should
have been just as dreadful for Poad as <i>that</i> is
for me. He’d have thought I was It.’</p>

<p>The voices and footsteps came nearer.
They were talking outside.</p>

<p>‘Best shoot it, when it rushes out at us.
I’ve got a revolver,’ said Poad. And a cold
shiver ran down Rupert’s back. Suppose he
had met Poad alone in that dark passage as he
had planned?</p>

<p>‘Let me get at him with the garden fork,’
said another voice—the gardener’s.</p>

<p>Then another, a strange voice this time:</p>

<p>‘Don’t hurt the beast. It’s valuable. An’
it’s tame, don’t I tell you? You leave be.
Stand back. I’ll tackle him.’</p>

<p>Rupert wretchedly wondered how he was
to be trapped; also, how near the real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a><br /><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a><br /><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
leopard really was. He decided that a little
noise more or less couldn’t matter now. He
tapped at the door and cried, ‘Let me out.
It’s Rupert.’</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 381px;">
<img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="381" height="587" alt="The Leopard captured" />
<div class="caption">‘It’s me; it’s Rupert,’ he shouted.</div>
</div>

<p>But his words were drowned in the chorus
of alarm that rose when he knocked at the
door. And the leopard? In the midst of the
babel of voices a bolt was drawn, the door
opened. Rupert sprang out and turned to
shut the door. But his feet and arms and
head were entangled in strings, and he fell to
the ground.</p>

<p>‘It’s me; it’s Rupert,’ he shouted; ‘shut
the door! The real leopard’s inside!’</p>

<p>‘Why!’ said the leopard’s owner—he who
had thrown the net over Rupert—‘it’s a beastly
boy, dressed up.’ He spoke in tones of deep
disgust.</p>

<p>There was a crowd of people. The three
C.’s had managed to scale the wall by means
of a pear-tree. They had brought back
William—a prey to secret laughter, and the
leopard’s owner, and a dozen other people. A
score of hands helped to loose Rupert from
the net.</p>

<p>‘Oh, I don’t know. I did it for a lark.
To take a rise out of some one. But I’ve been
paid out. The leopard’s in there. I touched
it, in the dark.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>Sensation!</p>

<p>‘There,’ said William to the policeman, ‘I
told you half an hour ago there was a good
chance the beast ’ad taken cover in the
passage, and you would have it you see his
tail up a tree somewhere, and wouldn’t go
down.’</p>

<p>‘I certainly thought I see ’is tail,’ said
Poad, scratching his ear; ‘and this gentleman’s
pal and half a dozen others is after ’im now,
down by the other lodge. But perhaps it
wasn’t really ’is tail. In fact, it couldn’t be, if
the animal’s in here like what the young
gentleman says it is.’</p>

<p>‘I tell you the leopard’s in here, now,’
said Rupert. ‘Oh, get me out of this beastly
skin somebody.’</p>

<p>William unlaced him, and he stepped out, a
pale boy in shirt and knickerbockers.</p>

<p>‘In there now, is he?’ said the leopard’s
keeper, rudely taking no notice of Poad; ‘then
if some one’ll get a lantern or two we’ll go in
and get him.’</p>

<p>Some one got a lantern or two—it was
William in point of fact; the lanterns happened
to be ready in the summer-house.</p>

<p>The keeper went down the steps.</p>

<p>‘On the right-hand side?’ he said, quite
unconcernedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>And Rupert said, ‘Yes, to the right.’</p>

<p>William and three other men followed
warily, but to most of the party it seemed best
to remain by the door. Five people and a net
were surely enough to catch one leopard.
But every one crowded round the door, and
some even went down a few steps, bending
over to catch the first sounds of anything that
might be happening.</p>

<p>All of a sudden a sound came from the
dark passage below, and the listeners started
back—a strange sound, the sound of long, loud
laughter. It echoed and re-echoed through
the vaulted passage, coming nearer and nearer.
The crowd drew back.</p>

<p>Out came the leopard keeper, laughing,
with his net; out came William, laughing,
with his pitchfork; out came Poad, half
laughing and half angry.</p>

<p>‘What is it? what is it?’ said every one
outside. And for a moment none of those
inside could get breath to answer.</p>

<p>‘What is it?’ they asked again, and at last
William answered:</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Wilmington’s old cat! Gone in there
to have her kittens in peace away from the
children. They’ve caught your little bit all
right,’ he said to the leopard keeper. ‘Look!’
He pointed to something white among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
trees beyond the wall. ‘I told Bill to run up
a signal if they found the rest of him where
Poad said he’d seen his spotted tail.’</p>

<p>‘Did you know that before we went in?’
Poad asked sternly.</p>

<p>‘’Course I did,’ said William, his hands on
his knees and his ruddy face deeply creased
with the joke. ‘You wouldn’t have catched
me going in there without I’d known where
my Lord was, him and his spotted tail. I
thought it was Master Rupert up to some
more of his larks, I did. I wasn’t a-going to
spoil sport.’</p>

<p>‘You ’aven’t ’eard the last of this,’ said Poad
huffily.</p>

<p>‘No more ain’t you,’ said William, ‘so don’t
you think it, James Poad. You that believed
one tale when you’d seen the other. You
that wouldn’t believe the sworn evidence of
your own eyes and a spotted tail.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>F. OF H.D.</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> will hardly be able to believe that, owing
to the firmness of Uncle Charles’s instructions
that he was not to be disturbed on any
pretence, the whole noisy affair of the two
leopards passed entirely unnoticed by him.
The three C.’s did not tell, because they
feared that Rupert’s impersonation of the
leopard might not be pleasing to the Uncle.
Mrs. Wilmington did not tell, because Rupert
was her great favourite. She mended the
places where the harp-strings had torn the
leopard skin, and put it back in its place and
said nothing to any one. William did not tell;
he was a man who could keep a joke to himself,
was William. Poad did not tell, because
he never could be quite sure whether the
laugh was on his side or on William’s. And
Rupert did not tell, for reasons that will be
clearer later on. So the Uncle went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
writing his book about <i>Sympathetic Magic</i>,
in complete ignorance of anything leopardish
having happened.</p>

<p>When all the fuss and bustle had died
down, and Rupert and the children were left
face to face, words of reproach rose to every
lip. But Rupert, knowing what he had faced
in that underground passage for the sake of
the children, still had enough of the warm and
comforting feeling to be able to say:</p>

<p>‘Look here, don’t! I’m awfully sorry if I
did really frighten you. I didn’t know. I’d
no <i>idea</i> what it would feel like to be frightened
by a leopard until I thought I was shut up
with one. Don’t rub it in; there’s good chaps.’</p>

<p>A frank appeal such as this could not fail
with the three C.’s, and if anything had been
needed to melt the anger of the girls, being
called ‘good chaps’ would have supplied that
need.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ they said, both together. ‘But
do let’s tell each other all about it,’ Charlotte
added. ‘Let’s not say anything till after
dinner, and then have a grand palaver in the
garden. I do want to understand just exactly
what you felt when you felt the leopard,
Rupert, to see if it was anything like what we
felt when we saw your spots.’</p>

<p>‘All right!’ said Rupert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 388px;">
<img src="images/i_332.jpg" width="388" height="595" alt="learning to swim" />
<div class="caption">Charles had his first swimming lesson.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a><br /><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>And Charles said, ‘It was the most dreadful
thing in the world, but it will give us something
to talk about.’</p>

<p>It did. Rupert’s hidden consciousness of
having done something ‘rather decent,’ made
him quite like the self that he had seemed to
be on the first night. The children spent a
most enjoyable afternoon, and for the first
time for many days, Rupert did not seem
anxious to get rid of the others. He even
invited them to come down to the river and
see him dive.</p>

<p>‘Though I’m not a patch on Mr. Penfold,’
he said.</p>

<p>They went. And Charles had his first
swimming lesson.</p>

<p>‘It would be all right,’ he said, sleeking his
wet hair as they went home, ‘if only you could
remember which are your arms and which are
your legs. I never can, in the water, and,
anyhow, you seem to have far too many, and
they all feel as though they belonged to somebody
else.’</p>

<p>As they went over the bridge, Mr. Penfold
said:</p>

<p>‘I’ve done that translation, and I’ve had it
typed. So you can tell your uncle about it
and present it to him. He’ll like it awfully, I
know. And I daresay he’ll let you have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
copy of the translation. I’ve had one done
expressly for you, with the parts that wouldn’t
be of any advantage to you left out. By the
way, there’s something written in the end
about the seventh of July. That’s to-morrow.
So you’d better present it then.’</p>

<p>There was a chorus of thanks, and the
presentation was arranged for the next day.
The children took the old Latin book home
with them. Mr. Penfold was to bring the
translation; ‘when I’ve corrected the spelling
and the stops,’ he said. ‘I’ll come, if I may,
and see the presentation. There should be
flowers, too, I think, symbolic flowers, suggested
by your other book.’</p>

<p>When the children got home they spread
the Latin book on the table in the window, to
catch the last rosy sunset light, and Charles
said with proud affection:</p>

<p>‘<i>Now</i>, Rupert! We don’t want any old
translation when <i>you’re</i> here.’</p>

<p>Rupert frowned, and the girls shrank as
sensitive plants shrink when a finger touches
them. They knew the sort of bitter thing
about its not being worth while to do things
for kids, which seemed to be trembling on
Rupert’s lips. But quite quickly his face
changed. He turned red—or was it only the
deepened red of the sunset?—and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You know, I’m afraid I’ve kidded you
rather about my Latin. I’m not very good at
it as a matter of fact. I’ve only just begun
Virgil.’</p>

<p>‘But you do know a lot. You’re always
saying bits of it,’ said Charles anxiously.</p>

<p>‘That was swank,’ said Rupert strongly;
‘silly swank. It was all wrong, I expect.
There, now it’s out!’</p>

<p>The children treated Rupert with added
respect.</p>

<p>‘How splendid of him to own up about the
Latin,’ said Caroline over the hair-brushing.
And Charlotte reminded her sister that <i>she</i>
had <i>always</i> thought Rupert splendid, which
was not true, though she thought it was.</p>

<p>But this was later. At the moment, ‘Never
mind,’ said Charlotte, ‘we shall have the translation
to-morrow, and we’ll try a spell <i>at once</i>.
I’m sorry the leopard that spoke was only you,
Rupert. We did think you’d have to believe
in spells after that.’</p>

<p>‘There’s something written at the end,’ said
Caroline, who was still examining the book;
‘I’d forgotten about that.’</p>

<p>And there was. In very faint brown ink.
They had to carry it quite outside the front
door (which was, as you know, at the side), to
get light enough to be sure that they could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
read it because it was written in Latin. And
when they did get enough light, they saw that
it was in English, and that they could. The
writing ran:</p>

<p>‘On the seventh day of the seventh month,
and at the seventh hour, let the seed be sown.
Seven seeds and no more for the one sowing.
In the garden of peace let them be sown,
which same is the seventh garden of the world.
Let him that would sow, take heed to bathe
him seven times in fair water, and let him sow
with his face set eastward, with silence at the
lips and, at the heart, faith in all good things
and the love of all things beautiful. After
seven weeks the blossom shall appear. Then
let him who sowed the seed eat of the flower.
The seed of the F. of H.D.’</p>

<p>‘What?’ cried Rupert.</p>

<p>‘That’s all,’ said Caroline; ‘it stops short
like that. There isn’t any more.’</p>

<p>There had been more, but some one had
scratched the rest out.</p>

<p>‘With a knife or scissors,’ explained
Caroline. ‘Oh, what a pity!’</p>

<p>‘I say,’ Rupert was beginning, but Charles
interrupted.</p>

<p>He had stooped to look up under the page
that Caroline was fingering. ‘There’s some
more; look, turn over!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>There was.</p>

<p>‘Until it be granted none knoweth his
heart’s most dear desire. But after it is
granted he perceiveth that so and not otherwise
was and must ever have been the true
Desire of the Heart.’</p>

<p>‘That’s true, at any rate,’ said Charlotte.
‘I was just wondering what my heart’s desire
really was. Suppose you thought it was going
to be a new paint-box, but the flower knew
better, and it turned out that elephants was
what you really wanted?’</p>

<p>‘No, but I say,’ said Rupert hurriedly,
‘look here! You know I don’t believe in
magic. I’d like to, really I would. But I
found something. You’ve got the key of the
drawing-room. I believe I know where those
seeds are.’</p>

<p>The drawing-room was almost dark when
they got there. Just one last ray of dusky
gold lay across the room; it struck the round
mirror and was reflected with dazzling brightness
on some golden object at the end of the
room. ‘The harp!’ whispered Rupert. ‘How
queer, because it was exactly there——’</p>

<p>It was still exactly there. And every one
was quite sure that this little round box held
the seeds of which the book told.</p>

<p>‘See,’ said Charlotte, holding them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
ray of yellow light; ‘they’re shaped like
hearts, and they’re pink like wishes. I know
wishes are pink. They must be some colour,
and why not that?’</p>

<p>‘But ought we to take them?’ was the
blighting question of Caroline.</p>

<p>It was settled by a note which Harriet
obligingly carried to the Uncle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Uncle</span>—There are some pinky seeds
in the drawing-room. May we have seven to sow?</p></div>

<p>And the answer was:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Certainly. Seventy if you like.—Your</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 8em;">D.S.T.U.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>So, very early next morning they got up.
Bathing seven times is no joke, especially when
you dry thoroughly between, and this Caroline
conscientiously insisted on. ‘We must be
<i>quite</i> sure we get it <i>quite</i> right,’ she said.</p>

<p>The four children met, by appointment, at
the top of the stairs and crept down in silence.
They went out by the French window which
had once admitted Rupert. When they were
outside, he said, ‘I bathed seven times too,
because Charles did nothing but bother.
But it’s no good <i>my</i> sowing the things, even
if it’s all true. Because I haven’t faith in my
heart, or my head either. I think really it’s
the head’s fault.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, never mind your head,’ said Charlotte;
‘we’ll all sow one each, and the three over
we’ll put in all together—all of us.’</p>

<p>The grass was still dewy-wet, but the
gardener was at work in the Wonderful
Garden. The children went through the
ancient formula of ‘ena dena dina dus,’ to
decide who should approach him, and the lot
fell on Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Please,’ she said, ‘may we have a bit of
garden for our own?’</p>

<p>‘Ay,’ said the gardener, pointing to a
vacant plot near the arbour.</p>

<p>‘Oh, thank you,’ said Charlotte, ‘but mayn’t
we have a bit in the garden of peace?’</p>

<p>‘Who learned you to call it that?’ the
gardener asked, looking at her strangely.</p>

<p>‘It’s the right name, isn’t it?’ Charlotte
asked with sudden anxiety.</p>

<p>‘It’s the right name right enough,’ he admitted.</p>

<p>‘We want a bit that won’t be disturbed for
seven weeks,’ Charlotte explained, and he
looked at her more strangely than ever.</p>

<p>‘Sure you’ve got the right seed to sow?’</p>

<p>Charlotte opened her hand and he stooped
and looked at it. Then he stood up and
saluted like a soldier.</p>

<p>‘Why——’ said Charlotte, ‘you—what do
you mean?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Nothing!’ he said, straightening his back;
‘only I worked here all my days, and my
father afore me, and his father afore him, and
so on back. You can see our names on the
stones in the churchyard, same as you see
Master’s people’s names on the tombs inside
of the church. I’ll find a corner for you, my
dear, and no one shan’t disturb the seed, once
you’ve set it. You know how it’s done?
No chatter, and which way to look?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I know,’ said Charlotte, ‘but how do
you know?’</p>

<p>‘Old man’s tales,’ he said; ‘old man’s tales,’
and led the way to the terrace.</p>

<p>‘Would you like to sow one of them?’ said
Charlotte eagerly. ‘I know the others won’t
mind if you would. Would you?’</p>

<p>‘Not me, my dear,’ said the old man, and
he sighed. ‘Years agone, I don’t say. But
not now. I’m old, you see. I ain’t got no
heart’s desires nowadays except what I’ll get
in the way of nature and in the Lord’s good
time. You go along and set your seeds.
I’m glad I seen ’em though. Over yonder,
between the lupins and the larkspurs. That’ll
be your plot, and I’ll mark the place.’</p>

<p>Charlotte, very much impressed, beckoned
the others. In silence they sowed the seed.
The gardener watched them, and when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
had planted the seeds and covered them over,
he took a pencil and a painted slip-label from
his pocket, wrote on it and stuck it in the
ground. The children stooped to read what
he had written.</p>

<p>‘F. of H.D.’ it said.</p>

<p>‘Well!’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Least said, soonest mended,’ said the
gardener. ‘I shouldn’t wonder if seed leaves
was to break ground in seven days. It was
allus a wonderful garden, this was,’ he said,
and turned to his work.</p>

<p>‘Well!’ said Charlotte again, and they went
back through the dewy park.</p>

<p>After breakfast the <i>Language of Flowers</i> was
earnestly consulted.</p>

<p>‘It’s no use going on thinking and talking
about the F. of H.D.,’ said Caroline, when they
had talked of nothing else for an hour and a
half. ‘What we’ve got to do now, is to find
the right flowers for the presentation.’</p>

<p>An hour’s earnest study of Miss Peckitt’s
invaluable present yielded an interesting list.
‘Learning’ had apparently no floral emblem,
so blue salvia, which means ‘Wisdom,’ was
chosen to represent it. It was felt that on an
occasion of this sort it was impossible to have
too much of a good thing, so twelve flowers
were chosen, and all but one, an outsider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
called circæa, which means a spell, of which
the gardener had never heard, were found in
the Wonderful Garden.</p>

<p>Rupert prevailed on Mrs. Wilmington to
open the drawing-room on the ground that the
clergyman was coming to tea, and she even
agreed to allow the floral tributes to be arranged
on a large table in that hallowed sanctuary, only
insisting that a linen drugget should be laid
down before so much as a blade of grass was
carried in.</p>

<p>The drugget, white with many a washing,
only seemed to add to the festival air which
the drawing-room soon began to put on.</p>

<p>‘Talk of magic,’ said Charlotte; ‘what is it if
it’s not that with Mrs. Wilmington? Rupert
can drive her with a rein of darning cotton.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington had indeed consented to
‘do’ the vases on the mantelpiece and cabinets,
‘rather than have you children smashing
everything to atoms,’ she said, and even, at
Rupert’s request, had agreed to put only the
flowers he handed to her. ‘Though a shabbier
lot,’ she said, ‘it was never my lot to beheuld.
More like a passel of weeds, I should say.’</p>

<p>The selected flowers were certainly none
too showy. And the drawing-room decorations
might perhaps have, in the end, looked what
Mrs. Wilmington called ‘mingy,’ if Charlotte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
had not suddenly remembered that the rose,
as the flower of secrecy, was entitled to be
present, in, as she said, ‘the richest profusion.’</p>

<p>The large table was covered with loose pink
rose leaves. That was Caroline’s idea. ‘Yes,’
she said, ‘I know what it will remind them
of. But reminding doesn’t matter when all’s
forgotten and forgiven, and look how soft and
fluffy they look, like pink fur.’</p>

<p>This also reminded one of things. But no
one said anything, though every one tried so
hard not to look at the leopard skin that they
might just as well have been staring at it.</p>

<p>‘How pretty the flowers look, reflected in
the looking-glasses,’ said Caroline tactfully;
and Charlotte, with less tact but equal goodwill,
moved an embroidered stool between
Rupert and the leopard’s spotted hide.</p>

<p>Tea was a meal of masked excitement, of
gigglings scarcely suppressed by the children,
and of a careful air of there being nothing
particular in the wind on the part of Uncle
Charles and Mr. Penfold. When the last cup
had been emptied, the last piece of cake reduced
to crumbs and memory, Charles was at last
allowed to say the words which had been
arranged for him to say, and which, all through
the meal, he had been bursting to repeat.</p>

<p>‘Please, uncle, there is a meeting of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Society of the Secret Rose in the drawing-room,
and the Rosicurians have got a present
for you’—‘a presentation,’ corrected Charlotte—‘a
presentation, and will you please come and
be presented.’</p>

<p>‘It’s all wrong,’ said Charlotte, who had
composed the speech for him and had the
natural vanity of an author. But every one
was getting out of their chairs, and in the noise
they made, nobody heard her.</p>

<p>The drawing-room certainly looked, as
Harriet had said when she peeped into it
before tea, ‘a fair treat’—with its white-spread
floor; its vases and jugs and jars of roses;
its rose-leaf-covered table, edged with the
twelve symbolic flowers in jam-pots, white and
elegantly small; and all the splendour of
afternoon sunshine real and reflected. The
Uncle looked at the room over his glasses,
just as though he had never seen it before.</p>

<p>‘Beautiful,’ he said; ‘very beautiful.’</p>

<p>Charlotte took him by the hand and said:</p>

<p>‘Dear uncle, this time we make you a
presentation, and it’s not to get anything out of
you. But just to show what we think of you.
Caroline will read you what we’ve written,
like addresses to mayors, you know. We
hadn’t time to illuminate it to-day, but we will
afterwards, if you like. And when she ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>s
read it, we will give you the real presentation.
It is under the basin in the middle. But you
mustn’t look at it till we say——’</p>

<p>She stopped. The others looked at her
meaningly.</p>

<p>‘I can’t help it,’ she said, flushing. ‘I’ve
forgotten the words. Uncle saying “Beautiful”
put it out of my head. But it means the same
as the words I settled to say, and Charles didn’t
remember his either.’</p>

<p>‘Your address was exactly what all addresses
should be,’ said the Uncle—‘short and to the
point. I pledge my honour to respect the
secret of the basin until I am permitted to
approach it.’</p>

<p>The basin was a great bowl of blue and
white china that, reversed, occupied the middle
of the table. On it lay a full-blown rose and
two buds.</p>

<p>Caroline unfolded a large sheet of paper
of the size called demy and the kind which
is used to bake cakes on, line boxes with, and
drain fried fish on. Caroline had begged it
from the cook, and there was a good deal of
violet ink on it.</p>

<p>‘Hem!’ said Caroline, turning the large
pages. ‘Oh yes, it begins here.’</p>

<p>‘To the noblest of known Uncles, Charlotte,
Charles, and Caroline present their compliment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>s
and thanks. We have culled in your
wonderful garden the blossoms we think express
all the things we want to say. These dainty
floral pets’ (can you tell which part of this
address came out of the <i>Language of Flowers</i>,
and which was Caroline’s own invention?)—‘these
dainty floral pets represent the most
delicate and appropriate sentiments, and, offered
to the beloved object, cannot fail to convey the
deepest secrets of the enamoured heart. All
our hearts are yours, dear uncle, because you
are such a brick. The flowers are’—she
pointed to the first pot on the left—‘branch
of currants. It means “you please us all.”
Because you do. Next pot—yellow acacia.
We only got leaves, because it flowers a
different time, but it means “secret love.”
Our uncle is in a secret society with us and
we love him being in it.</p>

<p>‘“Clematis indicates that beauty of the mind
without which the fairest bodily endowments
are but fleeting shows.” Uncle is clever, so
we got clematis. And white pinks mean
“talent,” so we got them. Sorrel we got,
partly because it means affection, and partly
because it is pretty and there is lots of it.
And plane-tree looks dull, but in reality “it
indicates to the discerning recipient that the
giver considers himself privileged to offer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
tribute of its agreeable foliage to the hands
of Genius.” That means the Uncle, because
he writes books. Pythagoras says a lot about
plane-trees. “Laurel needs no words to
inform the reader of its meaning. It is too
well known as the ornament of the foreheads
of the great. It also signifies success,” and
we hope your book will be a great success.
Red clover means industry, because uncle works
so hard every day and not to be disturbed
on any pretence. And “nightshade whose
dark leaves and mysterious purple blossoms
denote witchcraft and magic.” We have mixed
roses with that, because they mean love, and
uncle loves witchcraft. So do we. And so we
have put the double daisy. “This innocent
little flower in its double state has, humble as
it is, a deep meaning to the student of the
language of our floral darlings. It signifies
‘I share your sentiments,’” so we put it
last, because we share uncle’s about magic
and things, and we hope he will share ours
about the presentation when he sees it.
That’s all,’ said Caroline, very much out of
breath.</p>

<p>‘Hear, hear!’ said Mr. Penfold; and the
Uncle said:</p>

<p>‘Thank you; thank you very much. The
most learned and delightful address I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
ever listened to. And the flowers are beautiful
in themselves as well as in their symbolism.’</p>

<p>‘We’re so glad you like it,’ said Charles, ‘but
wait till you see the presentation. He may
look now, mayn’t he, Caro?’</p>

<p>‘Lift up the basin,’ said Charlotte; ‘be careful
not to drop it, uncle, it’s awfully heavy.’</p>

<p>Uncle Charles raised the great bowl in his
hands and set it down among the rose leaves.
Under it was a white cloth covering something
and on the cloth another red rose, full blown,
and two buds.</p>

<p>‘This is the real inside heart of the presentation,’
said Caroline. ‘Don’t look for a minute.
We found them inside Pope’s <i>Iliad</i> and
<i>Thessalonians</i>. And we are almost sure they
are. And we hope you’ll be pleased.’</p>

<p>‘I can hardly believe that I could be more
pleased than I am already,’ said the grateful
uncle, and with that he lifted the white cloth
(one of Caroline’s best handkerchiefs) and laid
bare the books.</p>

<p>There was a breathless silence. The Uncle
lifted the books and looked at them.</p>

<p>‘You know,’ he said presently in almost
a broken voice, ‘I believe they are. I am
almost sure they are.’ Then he said nothing
for a minute and then, ‘Thank you,’ he said;
‘thank you,’ and opened the book again. ‘It’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
make all the difference,’ he said to Mr. Penfold;
‘absolutely all the difference.’</p>

<p>‘We found them,’ Charles was beginning,
when Mr. Penfold made him a sign to be
silent, and made another sign towards the
door. Then he led the way from the room.
The children followed, and when they were all
out he closed the door softly.</p>

<p>‘When people are very happy or very
unhappy, they like to be left alone. I think
that just now your uncle is very happy.’</p>

<p>‘How glorious!’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘So am I,’ said Mr. Penfold. ‘An angel
in human form, called Mr. James Hodgkinson,
has sent me five pounds towards restoring the
church. I have blued the lot on tiles for the
roof of the porch. If you like to come down
you can help put them on. Like to?’</p>

<p>‘Rather!’ was the enthusiastic answer of
the three C.’s.</p>

<p>Rupert did not answer. And when they
looked round to see why he did not answer,
they saw that it was because he was not
there.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE WAXEN MAN</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">You</span> know what Rupert was saying that day,’
said Charles one day when Rupert as usual
was down at Mr. Penfold’s, ‘about doing something
real with our magic?’</p>

<p>‘Like making her come alive,’ said Charlotte,
looking up at the picture of Dame
Eleanour.</p>

<p>‘No, like making wax images of people and
sticking pins in them. I should like to do that.
I feel as if the <i>Language Of</i> was bust up,
somehow.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, don’t say that,’ said Caroline, pained.</p>

<p>‘Well, not for always, perhaps,’ said Charles
kindly; ‘but we did give the Uncle such a
tremendous blow-out for his presentation, and
we did the leopard, and we sowed the F. of
H.D., and anything else seems rather piffling
after that. I wish we could make a wax image
of some one.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Not to stick pins in,’ said Caroline firmly.
‘That would be ink-black magic, I’m certain.
And very very wrong and unkind besides.’</p>

<p>‘No pins, I don’t mean,’ said Charles, ‘but
just make one. We could decide what to
stick into it after we’d made it.’</p>

<p>‘Caro and I wouldn’t agree to sticking anything
into it,’ said Charlotte; ‘and, anyhow,
you haven’t got any wax.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I have,’ said Charles triumphantly;
‘so there! I’ve been saving it up ever since
he said that.’</p>

<p>‘Where from?’ asked the girls together.</p>

<p>‘The sticking-out bits of candles,’ said
Charles, ‘and one or two ends out of candlesticks
in the morning when they are put on
the boot-shelf in the scullery to be cleaned.
It’s a good big lump now. Shall I get it?’</p>

<p>‘It would be fun to model something,’
Caroline admitted, and Charles, falling flat on
his front, felt behind the big books on the
bottom shelf and produced a large ball of a
grey semi-transparent nature.</p>

<p>‘Here it is,’ he said. ‘Now I’ll tell you
what I’ve thought. Only don’t tell Rupert.
We’ll do it first and tell Rupert afterwards.
And then he’ll have to believe.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what is it?’</p>

<p>‘We’ll make,’ said Charles slowly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
seriously, ‘a wax image of the Murdstone
man, and we’ll make him hollow, his legs
and arms needn’t be, nor his head, but just
his chest. And make his heart separate,
and put it in. And take out his heart and
melt it every day. That would soften his
heart, and he would say he was sorry and
Rupert would forgive him.’</p>

<p>‘“When hollow hearts shall wear a mask,”’
said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘That’s only song-nonsense. People die if
you take their hearts out,’ said Caroline with
conviction.</p>

<p>‘Well, then, don’t let’s make him hollow.
Let’s make him solid and then think what to do.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Charlotte; ‘but if he’s a
pig, he’s a pig, however solid you make
him. What’s bred in the bone will come
out in the wash. And if we’re not to stick
pins in him, what’s the good?’</p>

<p>‘Oh,’ said Caroline, ‘I think I know.
Look here! We’ll make the wax image and
then be kind to it. You can tame wild beasts
with kindness.’</p>

<p>‘It kills cats,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘No, it was Care killed the cat,’ Caroline
reminded her, ‘and, anyway, this won’t be a cat,
even if it did. We’ll think of nice things to do
to it. Let’s make it now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Bags I!’ said Charles hastily. ‘It was my
idea, and I collected the wax.’</p>

<p>‘Like an old bee,’ said Charlotte. ‘All right,
fire ahead.’</p>

<p>Charles had been warming the wax between
his hands, and now, hardly waiting
for Caroline to fetch and spread a newspaper,
he began to divide the wax into six
pieces.</p>

<p>‘One head, two arms, two legs, one body,’
he explained.</p>

<p>The girls watched with breathless interest.
Charles rolled the smallest piece of wax round
in his hands till it was like a marble, and the
biggest piece till it was like a fives ball; the
remaining four he rolled lengthwise till they
were like thick tobacco-pipes. Then he stuck
the four pipey bits and the round marble on to
the fives ball and held the whole thing out
triumphantly.</p>

<p>‘I think it’s awfully like,’ he said, ‘especially
the right arm that he hit Rupert with. I
<i>should</i> like to stick just one pin in that.’</p>

<p>‘You mustn’t,’ said Caroline. ‘Yes, it’s
awfully nice, but it hasn’t any clothes. I know
statues of Greek heroes don’t have any clothes.
But he’s not a Greek hero. And nowadays
people have to have clothes even in their
statues. Look at Mr. Gladstone. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
would be more like real if it had a nose and
ears, wouldn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘I say,’ said Charlotte, ‘let’s get bits of
bent twigs and pretend they’re him, and then
make wax clothes. Do let us help, Charles.
It does look so interesting to do. You shall do
the first kind thing for him if you’ll let us help
make him.’</p>

<p>‘<i>I</i> think he’s all right,’ said Charles, looking
at the blobby thing he had made, which was
more like an imperfect octopus than a man;
‘but if you promise me to do the first thing, I
don’t mind.’</p>

<p>‘Right O! I’ll get the sticks.’</p>

<p>When the sticks had been found, the three
children began to model parts of the Murdstone
man, but Caroline and Charles soon
stopped and were content to watch Charlotte.
She really seemed to know what she was
about, which the others felt could not be said
of them. She chose suitable twigs, fastened
them together with bits of wax, and then
began to clothe them with wax. She produced
an arrangement not at all unlike a jacket and
waistcoat. The trousers were a failure. The
most accomplished sculptors have admitted that
trousers are difficult to treat artistically. But
they remembered that, last time they had seen
him, the Murdstone man had worn knickerbockers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and in these, revealing the shape of
the stockinged human leg, Charlotte was considered
to have surpassed herself. The head
was very difficult, but even this was managed,
the hair question being settled by a large flat
cap with a peak. The new model had a nose
and mouth, ears large, but still ears, and hands
each with four fingers and a thumb. And
when Charlotte rolled up the tiniest bits of
wax, flattened them and stuck them on the
coat and waistcoat for buttons, Caroline
shouted, ‘Bravo! You’re as good as Praxi—what’s-his-name!’
and even Charles said it
wasn’t half bad.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said Charlotte, ‘the first nice thing
to do for him is to put him in a bed of rose
leaves. That’s what they say when they mean
a life without a sorrow or care.’</p>

<p>‘And then burn incense. We can make the
incense out of the proper flowers,’ Caroline
said.</p>

<p>‘Rose leaves are dull,’ Charles said, ‘and
perhaps the Murdstone man doesn’t like incense.’</p>

<p>‘The real one mayn’t. This one’s got to
like what we want it to like,’ said Charlotte.
‘We made him and <i>we</i> know what he’s got to
like.’</p>

<p>‘Then we might make it so that he’d like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
having pins stuck into him,’ Charles suggested
hopefully.</p>

<p>‘We might; only we shouldn’t be so silly.
Come on, bring the <i>Language Of</i> and the
Murdstone man. I’ll get a box and Caro can
get the rose leaves. We’ll go out and find a
secret place in the wood.’</p>

<p>A cardboard box that had held Charlotte’s
best shoes was filled with sweet pink petals and
the waxen image put in it. It looked better
standing up, but you don’t stand up in a bed,
even of rose leaves. A sort of pedestal was
built of old bricks brought with some toil from
the ruins of the deserted lodge’s pig-stye. A
flat stone, which took all three to lift, was
placed on top. And on this the box. But the
box, which said ‘Smarm and Simple’s Hygienic
Footwear’ in blue letters outside, troubled the
girls because it was ugly, and Charles because
it was untruthful.</p>

<p>‘Whatever he is, he isn’t footwear,’ said
Charles. ‘We could make it true by trampling
on him, but you won’t agree to that.’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Caroline, ‘but look here. Let’s
paste a bit of my green sash on it, and then
put moss round. That’ll make it more woodland-like.’</p>

<p>Cook provided the paste, and Caroline cut
the sash. She paste-wetted the first piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
silk so that it came out in wet spots, very messy
looking, as Charles did not fail to point out.</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Caroline, ‘I’ll cut
another bit—it’s much too long—and use
less paste.’</p>

<p>‘More paste less speed,’ said Charlotte.
‘I’ll cut mine. Then they’ll be alike, just as
they were before.’</p>

<p>This time the box certainly looked very
rich, and the moss round it looked very fresh
and beautiful.</p>

<p>A smaller pile of bricks supported the lid of
a cocoa-tin for incense.</p>

<p><i>The Language of Flowers</i>, hurriedly consulted,
informed them that jasmine stood for
amiability, St. John’s wort for animosity,
Indian pink for aversion, the pimpernel for
change, sage for esteem, and the hazel for
reconciliation. Further, that the tamarisk
stood for crime and the potato for benevolence.</p>

<p>All these were found in the Wonderful
Garden except the potato, and none of the
children knew what a potato looks like when
it is growing, and they did not like to ask
any one, for fear they in turn should be asked
what they wanted it for.</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Charles, ‘we can save
one from dinner. I don’t suppose it will matter
its being cooked.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>That the potatoes that day should happen
to be mashed, seemed to all a mishap yet not
a calamity. A quantity, deemed sufficient to
influence Mr. Murdstone through his waxen
image, was secreted in the envelope of a letter
from Aunt Emmeline, and not more than an
eighth of the potato escaped into Charles’s pocket
through the square hole where the Italian
stamp had been cut out for his collection.</p>

<p>‘We’ll arrange the things we want him to
be round the box,’ said Caroline, ‘and the
things we want him not to be we’ll burn and
call it incense.’</p>

<p>Charles owned that he had been wondering
what sort of incense you could make out of
mashed potato.</p>

<p>Jasmine, with its white stars, bright Indian
pinks, gay tufts of sage, and the oval-ringed
leaves of the hazel, arranged round the box,
made a charming tangle. ‘The silk wasn’t
wanted, really,’ said Charles. ‘The hygienic
boots would never have shown through the
flowers.’ But the girls agreed that it was nice
to know it was there.</p>

<p>The mashed potato and the rather faded
pimpernel were carefully concealed under the
more attractive offerings.</p>

<p>‘It looks fine,’ Charles said, and what he
said they all thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 388px;">

<div class="caption">Nothing much happened except smoke.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a><br /><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very hard to make small pieces of green
things burn in a cocoa-tin lid in the open air
by means of a box of matches, and the fragments
of a potato-dampened envelope from an
aunt in Italy. Nothing much happened except
smoke, and the head of a match burnt Charles’s
finger.</p>

<p>‘There’s no more paper,’ said he, ‘except
the bit we’ve written his name on.’</p>

<p>‘There’s the match-box,’ said Caroline;
‘let’s make a little bonfire with twigs and then
put the incense things on when it’s burnt up.’
This they did; and the starry gold of St.
John’s wort, the gay brightness of Indian pinks,
and the feathery greenness of the tamarisks
twisted and writhed amid flames and smoke.</p>

<p>‘Now we’ll leave it. Please, Murdstone
man, let your crimes and your animosity and
your aversion be burnt away, and may you lie
on beds of roses really as soon as you are
changed and amiable. Then when you are
truly benevolent, Rupert and us will esteem
you, and the hazel is for reconciliation. Now
let’s go away and leave the incense to do its
healing work, and to-morrow we’ll come and
put a fresh rose-bed and burn new incense.’
Thus Caroline. The others agreed, and after
having put on the box the label with the
Murdstone man’s name, so that Destiny could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
not pretend to make any mistake as to who
the witchcraft was meant for, they went away
through green coverts, in Indian file, to build
a wigwam in another part of the wood with
three hop poles, three red blankets, and their
three mackintoshes.</p>

<p>‘I hope Rupert won’t ask a lot of questions
about what we’ve been doing to-day,’ said
Charles. But Rupert did not ask any. He
came home singularly silent, and went to bed
early, announcing that he was going to spend
the following day, also, with Mr. Penfold.</p>

<p>‘So we needn’t tell him,’ said Charlotte,
‘till the good work is done. I’m glad of that.’</p>

<p>Next day, with a fresh armful of suitable
flowers and some more potatoes, fried this
time and bearing heavy traces of their close
intimacy with the breakfast bacon, the children
sought the secret spot where they had laid the
waxen image of Mr. Murdstone on its bed of
roses. The ashes of the incense bonfire were
there, the pedestal was there, the green-covered
box was there, half filled with half-faded
rose leaves; but the waxen image was
gone!</p>

<p>‘He must have fetched it away himself,’
said Charlotte, breaking an awe-struck pause;
‘he must have felt what we were doing and
made up his mind to be benevolent. And he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
fetched it away so that we shouldn’t waste any
more good potatoes on him.’</p>

<p>‘I wish he’d do something to show that he’s
changed into a Real Good and what sort of
Good he’s changed into,’ said Charles. And it
certainly is tiresome to work magic and then
not to know exactly how it has acted. That
their magic had acted, the children were of
course quite certain. They had done magic
too many times, as you know, to entertain a
moment’s doubt as to whether their spells were
going to work or not. And the fact that the
spell they had worked was not worked exactly
as the book said, did not trouble them. For,
as Caroline said, ‘If you can do harm to wax
people, you can do good to them. More
really, I should think. Because one’s wrong
and the other’s right.’</p>

<p>But it was a rather disappointed party that
took its way through the greenwood, leaving
the secret spot with its trampled flowers and
scattered ashes. They came across their wigwam
and spent the rest of the morning there,
and, when the dinner-bell rang, loaded themselves
with the mackintoshes and blankets
which had been forgotten yesterday.</p>

<p>As they trailed out of the wood into the
drive, Charles, who was first, dropped his
blanket and stopped short, blocking the view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of the others, who were following him down
the narrow path.</p>

<p>‘What is it? what is it?’ they asked.</p>

<p>‘Shish!’ said Charles and backed into the
hazel bushes, and the girls pressed forward to
see what there was to shish about. Then they
in turn backed into the green covert, and the
bushes closed over them as they stood there
holding their breath as footsteps went by them
along the drive. When the footsteps had
passed far enough away for the children to
dare to move, they backed with one consent
into the wood, not stopping till they came to
an open glade where they could comfortably
look at each other and exclaim, ‘Well!’ They
were past all other words. For what they
had seen was Rupert coming up the drive,
looking pale but not unhappy. And beside
him, with his hand on Rupert’s shoulder, and
talking to him in the friendliest way, was—the
Murdstone man!</p>

<p>‘Rupert will <i>have</i> to believe now!’ was the
first thing any one found breath to say. It was
Caroline who said it. The others still had not
breath enough for more than ‘Rather!’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE ATONEMENT OF RUPERT</small></h2>


<p class="unindent">‘<span class="smcap">I do</span> wonder what has happened,’ Charlotte
whispered. ‘I suppose the Murdstone man
was coming to tell Rupert he had been spell-changed
into being nice now. And he must
have met Rupert on the way.’</p>

<p>‘But he could have said that in the road
and then gone home. There must be some
reason for his coming home with Rupert. He
can’t,’ said Charles hopefully, ‘be going to
tell <i>us</i> that he’s changed? That would be
ripping.’</p>

<p>‘I expect he’s telling the Uncle,’ said
Caroline. ‘When the wicked Magician takes
off his spell and the wicked Prince turns good,
he always tells everybody at once.’</p>

<p>‘Then he’ll come and tell <i>us</i>,’ said Charles.
‘We’re part of everybody, the same as grown-up
people are.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>The three C.’s had come slowly back to the
house, and, seeing no sign of Rupert and the
changed Murdstone man, had, with great tact,
chiefly Caroline’s, refrained from going in
search of Rupert or of information.</p>

<p>They had just shut themselves into the
dining-room, and waited. For it was quite
plain that something more must happen. The
once-hated Murdstone man could not just come
to the house and go away again and the matter
end there. But waiting is tiresome work,
however proud you may be feeling of your
tact and delicacy, and you are so interested
and anxious that it is idle even to pretend to
read. The three C.’s were very glad indeed
when at last they heard footsteps in the hall,
and voices.</p>

<p>‘Now!’ said Caroline. ‘Now they’re coming.
We’ll be most awfully nice to him,
won’t we. Now he’s sorry and he’s owned up.’</p>

<p>‘Of course,’ said Charles. ‘Do you think
I could ask him to let me have the wax image
of him to keep in memorio?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ said Caroline, ‘of course you couldn’t.
Hush! for goodness’ sake, hush!’</p>

<p>But there seemed to be no urgent need for
hushing. The footsteps and the voices went
past the dining-room towards the front door,
which was at the side, as you know. No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
listened, yet no one could help hearing, through
the open window, the parting words of Rupert
and the Murdstone man:</p>

<p>‘I’ll do it now. That’ll be the last. Thank
you, sir. Good-bye!’</p>

<p>Then came the sound of retreating boots
on gravel. The front door banged, and next
moment Rupert came in. His eyes were very
bright and his face very pale. He came in,
shut the door, leaned against it, and seemed
to swallow nothing, twice. Then he said,
looking straight in front of him, and Charlotte
noticed that his hands were clenched:</p>

<p>‘Look here, I’ve got something to tell you.
I don’t suppose you’ll want to speak to me
again after it.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, we shall,’ said Charles, ‘whatever it
is.’</p>

<p>Rupert took no notice. He went on, after
a moment’s silence:</p>

<p>‘I told a lie about Mr. Macpherson, a beastly
lie. He didn’t hit me like I said he did. I
didn’t mean to say it, I just said it, and then
I couldn’t take it back. I’ve been most awfully
wretched. That’s all.’</p>

<p>‘But you’ve owned up now,’ was the only
comforting thing even Caroline could think of
in that terrible moment. Charles, as pale as
Rupert, with his eyes quite round, said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>‘You <i>couldn’t</i> have!’</p>

<p>Charlotte said nothing.</p>

<p>‘I’d like you to understand,’ said Rupert
miserably, ‘before I go away.’</p>

<p>‘Go away?’ said Charlotte quite as miserably.
‘Where?’</p>

<p>‘Back to Mr. Macpherson, of course. Your
uncle won’t keep me after this.’</p>

<p>‘Did he say so?’</p>

<p>‘No, he said I was to come back to him
when I’d taken Mr. Macpherson to the door.
But I feel I must tell you first, in case he
sends me off right away.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, Rupert,’ said Caroline, ‘I <i>am</i> so
sorry!’ And then she did something rather
heroic. She saw that Rupert wanted to say
more, wanted it desperately, and that he
could not possibly say it to all three of them
together, though he could have told it to one
of them, either to her or to Charlotte, if
they had been alone. So Caroline got up and
said:</p>

<p>‘Charles, come outside. I want to say
something’; and when she got him outside the
door, ‘come out,’ she said earnestly. ‘Yes,
you shall. Rupert doesn’t want the lot of us.
Let him talk to Charlotte. He can’t stand a
crowd.’</p>

<p>‘Isn’t it dreadful,’ said Charles in very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
shocked tones, ‘Rupert turning out a liar like
this?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, <i>don’t</i>,’ said Caroline hotly; ‘it must
have been awful for him, all this time. And
now he’s sorry and he’s owned up. We’ve
got to try and forget about it. Let’s talk about
something else.’</p>

<p>But it was very difficult to talk about something
else.</p>

<p>Rupert, left with Charlotte, saw the others
go past the window.</p>

<p>‘I wanted to tell you before,’ he said; ‘that
day when you talked about being disagreeable.
Only I couldn’t.’</p>

<p>‘Dear old Rupert!’ said Charlotte. ‘I’m
so jolly glad you’ve got rid of it. <i>That</i> was
the black dog. I knew there was something.
Do tell me, old chap, unless you’d rather not.
The others are off down the avenue.’</p>

<p>Rupert left the door and came to the table,
and, half-sitting on it, with his face turned
away, and twisting the table-cloth into pleats,
he said:</p>

<p>‘You know I always thought I was going
to be an extra honourable sort of chap. Father
used to say things. I never did anything like
it before. You see I was awfully sick at having
to go with Mr. Macpherson at all. He treated
me as if I was a baby. At least that’s what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
thought. He says now he meant to be kind and
he thought I was younger than I am. And the
bread and milk. Everything else I told you was
true except hitting me. And he did say there
were ways of dealing with sulky boys. And I
decided I would run away. And I hurt my hand
on a gate. And I was so angry, it seemed the
only thing to do.’</p>

<p>‘I know,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘And then, when I was explaining to you,
somehow I couldn’t find the proper words to
explain how hateful it was, and I thought you’d
think I’d run away just for nothing. And then
my hand hurt, and I thought you thought
something more ought to have happened. And
then I said that. Mean beast!’</p>

<p>‘I do <i>wish</i> you hadn’t,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘It didn’t seem to matter just at first. I
can’t think why. I thought he meant to hit
me next day, and, anyhow, you didn’t know
him. And then I got ill and nothing mattered.
But when I got better, it kept on getting
worse and worse and worse, like a corkscrew
worming into you harder and harder and
harder all the time.’</p>

<p>‘But why didn’t you own up before?’
Charlotte asked.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t. I never should have if it
hadn’t been for this.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>He pulled his handkerchief with some
difficulty from his pocket. Something was
wrapped in it. Rupert, his face still turned
away, unfolded and held out the waxen man.</p>

<p>‘I came back through the woods yesterday,
and then I saw you’d been trying that beastly
spell I told you with the pins.’</p>

<p>‘Oh!’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘And I knew it was because I’d told that
beastly lie.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, it <i>wasn’t</i>,’ said Charlotte. ‘We did
everything nice for him, to make him sorry
he was hateful and to make him friends with
you. And oh, Rupert, the spell <i>did</i> work!
We did it to make him friends with you.
<i>And he is.</i>’</p>

<p>‘He’s been jolly decent about it, anyhow,’
said Rupert. ‘I found the wax thing as I
came home from Mr. Penfold’s last night, and
I took it away and put it at the back of my
collar-drawer. And this morning I took it
down to Mr. Penfold’s. It made it easier to
tell, somehow. And <i>he</i> was jolly decent too.
He took me over to Tonbridge to tell Mr.
Macpherson. And he said a lot of things.
He said he’d known all along I’d got something
I wanted to get off my chest. And
he said things about repentance and things.
I do like him.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I’m glad we made the image,’ said Charlotte,
because it seemed unkind to say nothing, and
she could think of nothing else to say.</p>

<p>‘And I’m going to stick it, whatever it is.
Mr. Macpherson is all right, but it will be
hateful leaving here. Only I suppose you’ll
all be glad I’m going.’</p>

<p>‘Rupert!’</p>

<p>‘Well, then, I know <i>you</i> won’t really. I say,
Charlotte, you might tell the others. And tell
them I know I’ve been a grumpy brute, but it
was <i>that</i> going on all the time inside me like a
beastly Spartan fox. It’s been like waiting
at the dentist’s all the time, and this is like
having all your teeth out at once, twenty times
over.’</p>

<p>He tried to laugh, but he did not succeed
very well. Charlotte also tried, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>‘Don’t!’ said Rupert awkwardly. Charlotte
came close to him and rubbed her wet face
against his coat sleeve.</p>

<p>‘You’re sorry,’ she said, ‘and you’ve owned
up and you’ll never do it again.’</p>

<p>‘You bet I won’t,’ said Rupert. ‘I say,
don’t! It makes it ever so much worse. Now
I’ve got to go back to your uncle and get the
kick-out. And I jolly well deserve it.’</p>

<p>‘Just wait a minute,’ said Charlotte. ‘I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
going to get something I want to give you
before you go. Wait here, won’t you?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be long then,’ said Rupert in calm
wretchedness.</p>

<p>Charlotte dried her eyes and went out,
went to her own room and got her favourite
<i>Lays of the Scottish Cavaliers</i>. She wrote
Rupert’s name in it and then marched straight
to her uncle’s room, opened the door, and
went in.</p>

<p>Uncle Charles, for once, was not reading or
writing. He was sitting by his table drumming
on it with his fingers and looking both
sad and angry.</p>

<p>‘Uncle!’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Where is Rupert?’ said the Uncle, frowning.</p>

<p>‘He doesn’t know I’m here,’ said Charlotte,
answering her uncle’s thoughts rather than his
words. ‘I asked him to wait while I got
something to give him. Uncle, you aren’t
going to send him away, are you?’</p>

<p>‘I feel it only due to Mr. Macpherson to
send Rupert back,’ said the Uncle, ‘to show
that we regret the aspersions’—the Uncle
spoke as to a grown-up equal—‘the aspersions
cast on him by my abetting Rupert in his flight
and removing him from Mr. Macpherson’s care.
If it is a punishment to Rupert, it is not
an undeserved one.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charlotte, who hadn’t thought of
this, ‘but Rupert’s been punished—all the time
he has. No one else knows but me. He’s been
perfectly miserable. Only he just <i>couldn’t</i> tell.
And now he has, has told everybody, honourably
everybody. Oh, dear uncle, don’t; I <i>am</i>
so mizzy!’</p>

<p>‘Come here,’ said the Uncle, and Charlotte
found a thin black-coated shoulder a very good
place to cry on.</p>

<p>‘But you see,’ he said, ‘it’s only fair to
Mr. Macpherson to send Rupert back. I am
willing to believe that he has been punished
enough.’</p>

<p>‘You don’t know,’ said Charlotte; ‘he’s been
simply as unbearable as a bear, he’s been so
unhappy.’</p>

<p>‘I didn’t know that,’ said the Uncle slowly;
‘but no, it’s not fair to that man. Rupert must
go.’</p>

<p>Then Charlotte had one of her bright ideas,
and its brightness dried her tears.</p>

<p>‘Look here, uncle,’ she said, ‘I’ve got it—I
really have. Wouldn’t it make up to Mr.
Macpherson and show your confidence just
the same if you asked him to come here on
a visit?’</p>

<div class="caption">Charlotte found a thin black-coated shoulder a very good

</div>

<p>‘I <i>couldn’t</i>,’ said the Uncle, and it was plain
he spoke from the heart; ‘my work would all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a><br /><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a><br /><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
go—to pieces. I simply <i>can’t</i> have visitors,
grown-up ones, I mean. The books you’ve
found, they’ve revolutionised the whole scheme
of my work. Yet,’ he added thoughtfully, ‘I
owe you something for that.’</p>

<p>‘Then pay us with Rupert,’ said Charlotte
eagerly. ‘Couldn’t you bear Mr. Macpherson
just for one week-end? Then everybody
would know you were friends with him. Oh,
uncle, poor Rupert, he is so sorry. And he
did own up.’</p>

<p>‘What was that about a waxen image?’
asked the Uncle. Charlotte told him, and
he nodded now and then and said, ‘Yes,
yes!’ and ‘Exactly!’ And at the end he
said:</p>

<p>‘Well, you have attained your end. You
have reconciled them. The charm seemed to
have worked.’</p>

<p>‘They’ve all worked,’ said Charlotte,
‘every single charm we’ve tried. Have
yours, uncle?’</p>

<p>‘I wish they had,’ he answered, sighing.
‘Charlotte, I wish I could do what you wish.
Don’t try spells to make me, because I can’t.
Rupert must go back to-morrow, for a fortnight
at least. But he shall come back then till the
end of the holidays. Will that do? And I’ll
explain to him that it’s not punishment, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
just the <i>consequences</i> of what he did. If he
hadn’t told that lie he wouldn’t have had to
go back.’</p>

<p>‘But would you have kept him at first, if he
hadn’t told it?’ Charlotte asked.</p>

<p>‘He was unhappy there. That would have
been enough,’ said the Uncle—‘that and your
spells.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘It’s all right,’ said Rupert to Charlotte
later. ‘Your uncle’s forgiven me and I’m to
come back. And he explained why I must go.
And I see it. And I can stick it all right.
And I’d rather suffer it up and start fair. I’d
rather pay something. I shall have to write
and tell my father. That’s worse than anything.’</p>

<p>‘And when you come back,’ said Charlotte,
‘we shall think it was all a bad dream.’</p>

<p>He went next day. The three C.’s saw
him off at the station, all wearing arbor vitæ
in their button-holes to signify ‘unchanging
friendship,’ and Charlotte at the last moment
pressed the <i>Scottish Cavaliers</i> into his hand.</p>

<p>‘I say, though, wasn’t it <i>dreadful</i>, him telling
that lie,’ said Charles as they turned away
from the platform. It was a public place, but
one of his sisters shook him, then and there,
and the other said, ‘Look here, Charles, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
ever say another word about it, we’ll never
speak to you again. See?’</p>

<p>And Charles saw. ‘I don’t mean I don’t like
him and all that,’ he tried to explain, ‘but you
wouldn’t like me not to think lying was wrong,
would you?’</p>

<p>Then the girls saw.</p>

<p>‘You needn’t think we think <i>anything</i>,’ said
Caroline. ‘You just shut up, Charles. We’re
two to one.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE PORTRAIT</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> were now two things for the three C.’s
to look forward to: the return of Rupert and
Lord Andore’s coming-of-age party. The
magic of the waxen man had ended so seriously
that no one liked to suggest the trying of any
new spells, though Charlotte still cherished
the hope that it might some day seem possible
to try a spell for bringing the picture to life.
There were no directions for such a spell in
any of the books.</p>

<p>‘But,’ she thought, ‘considering all the
experience we’ve had, we ought to be able to
invent something.’</p>

<p>But the banishment of Rupert had left a
kind of dull blankness which made it difficult
to start new ideas. There was a sort of feeling
like a very wet Sunday when there is some one
ill in the house and you can’t go to church.
In Caroline and Charlotte there was a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
unacknowledged feeling that they ought to be
very good in order to make up for ‘poor
Rupert.’ And Charles cared little for anything
but swimming, in which art he was
progressing so far that he sometimes knew,
even in the water, which were his arms and
which were his legs, and could at least imagine
that he was making the correct movements
with all four.</p>

<p>Uncle Charles was less frequently visible
even than at first, though when he did appear
he was more like an uncle and less like a polite
acquaintance. The books the children had
discovered had meant a very great deal to him.
He told them so more than once. He went
away now, almost every other day, to London
to the British Museum, to Canterbury to its
Library, and once, for two days, to look up
some old parchments in the Bodleian Library,
which, as of course you know, meant going to
Oxford. Mr. Penfold was very kind, and the
children did quite a lot of building under his
directions, but altogether it was a flattish time.</p>

<p>Then suddenly things began to grow interesting
again. What began it was the visit
of a tall gentleman in spectacles. He had a
long nose and a thin face with a slow, pleasant
smile. He called when the Uncle was out and
left a card. Caroline heard Harriet explaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
that the Master was out, and rushed after the
caller in hospitable eagerness.</p>

<p>‘I’m sure uncle wouldn’t like you to go away
without resting,’ she said breathlessly, when he
stopped at the sound of her pattering feet on
the gravel, and she caught up with him, ‘after
you’ve come such a long way and such a hot
day, too.’</p>

<p>‘After you’ve brought me out so far and
made me trot so quick,’ he answered. And
after that of course one could no longer regard
him as a stranger. Charlotte and Charles, in
the meantime, had hastily examined the gentleman’s
card in the Russian bowl on the hall
table.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Alfred Appleby,’ it said, and added, as
Charlotte said, ‘most of the alphabet,’ beginning
with F.R.S., F.S.A., and this mingled with his
name so that when Caroline privately asked
them what was on the card, they could only
think of Mr. Alphabet.</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby accepted Caroline’s invitation
and turned back with her.</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry,’ she said, ‘that I can’t take you
straight into the drawing-room, but if you don’t
mind waiting in the dining-room a minute, I’ll
get the drawing-room key and take you in
there, only I’m afraid the dining-room’s rather
awful, because we’ve been thinking of playing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
Red Indians, and the gum is drying on the
scalps on most of the chairs.’</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby declined the drawing-room at
any price, and was able to tell them several
things they did not know about Red Indians,
wampum, moccasins, and war-paint. He was
felt to be quite the nicest thing that had
happened since what Caroline and Charlotte in
private conversation always spoke of as ‘that
awful image day.’ When Mrs. Wilmington
came in to see what those children were up
to, Mr. Appleby won her heart by addressing
her as Mrs. Davenant. ‘Took me for the lady
of the house at once,’ she told Harriet. And
Mrs. Wilmington drew Caroline aside and said:</p>

<p>‘If you’d like to ask the gentleman to lunch,
Miss Caroline, please yourself. There’s fowls,
as it happens, and a Paradise pudding, and
peas. Perhaps your uncle would wish it.’</p>

<p>So the gentleman stayed to luncheon, and
very good company they found him. He told
the most amusing stories, all new to the
hearers. He carved the fowls in a masterly
way and had two goes of pudding. And all
the time he looked with exactly the right
admiration and wonder at the portrait of Dame
Eleanour in her ruff, with her strange magic
philtres and her two wonderful books.</p>

<p>‘We found those books, Mr. Alphabet,’ said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Charlotte. And then the whole story had to
be told. Mr. Alphabet—for so we may call
him now—was deeply interested, and nodded
understandingly as the tale of the different
spells unfolded itself to his intelligent questioning.</p>

<p>‘And do you propose to continue your
experiments?’ he asked, when he had heard the
tale of the leopard, the last of the adventures
which <i>could</i> be told, for the affair of the wax
man was of course a thing that could never be
disclosed.</p>

<p>‘There’s nothing particular that we want to
do a spell about, just now,’ said Caroline. ‘I
did think of trying to do one to get father
and mother home, but it might be very inconvenient
to them to leave India just now.
You never know, and we shouldn’t like to
work a spell that would only be a worry to
them.’</p>

<p>Mr. Alphabet said, ‘Quite so!’</p>

<p>‘What <i>I</i> keep on wanting to try,’ said
Charlotte, ‘is to make <i>her</i> come alive,’ she
nodded towards the picture; ‘only there doesn’t
seem to be any spell for that in any of the
books. She looks such a dear, doesn’t she?
Suppose she made a spell herself and did something
magic to that picture, so that it should
come alive if some one in nowadays-times got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
hold of the other end of the spell; you know
what I mean?’</p>

<p>‘Quite so,’ said the visitor; ‘why not?’</p>

<p>‘It wouldn’t be the real her, I suppose?’
said Charlotte, ‘but it might be like a cinematograph
and a phonograph mixed up. I
want to see her move and hear her speak, like
she did when she was alive.’</p>

<p>And again the gentleman said, ‘Why not?’</p>

<p>‘If only we could find out the proper spell,’
said Charles. ‘You see, everything came right
that we’ve done, from the fern-seed on. Only
we can’t.’</p>

<p>‘I must think it over,’ said Mr. Alphabet;
‘and now I think as I’ve stayed so long, I’ll
take the liberty of inviting myself to stay till
your uncle returns. I should very much like
to see this Wonderful Garden. And perhaps
you’ll permit me to smoke an after-dinner pipe
there?’</p>

<p>The afternoon passed delightfully. Mr.
Alphabet was one of those people with whom
you feel comfortable from the first. He
understood what you said, which is one of the
two feet on which comfortable companionship
stands; and he said nothing that you could
not understand if you really used your brains,
and that is the other foot. He told them the
names of many flowers which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
strangers to them, and he talked of magic—Indian
magic and Chinese magic, the magic
of Egypt and of Ceylon, of Australia and of
Mexico; and they listened and longed for more,
and got more to listen to. When, after tea, the
Uncle returned, and having warmly greeted
Mr. Alphabet took him away to his study, the
children agreed that their new friend was the
‘right sort,’ and that they hoped they would
see him again often.</p>

<p>‘Once a week, at least,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Once a day,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>They saw him once again, and once only.</p>

<p>And that was when, he and the Uncle
having come out of the study together, the
Uncle went to see William about putting the
horse in to drive Mr. Alphabet to the station,
and Mr. Alphabet came into the dining-room
to say good-bye to the children.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been thinking over what you said
about Dame Eleanour,’ he said to Charlotte,
‘and I’ll tell you what. You ask your uncle
to allow you to hang a green curtain over her,
frame and all, and then make garlands of
suitable flowers. Then hang the garlands
across the picture and wait. You must never
lift the curtain, of course, and the curtain
must be green. And you must wish very
much to see her move and to hear her speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
And I shall be very much surprised if you
don’t in—let me see—in about three weeks.
The curtain must be green, mind. Nothing
else will do. Don’t let your housekeeper fob
you off with a red moreen or an old blue
damask. Green’s the colour.’</p>

<p>‘And do you really think?’ asked Charlotte
with gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>‘Well, with any one else I shouldn’t dare
to think anything. But you’ve been so exceptionally
fortunate hitherto, haven’t you?
With <i>you</i> I should think there could be no
doubt of success. I don’t say you’ll see her
<i>here</i>, mind you. I don’t say how or when
you will see her. These things are among
the great mysteries. Perhaps one day when
you’re at breakfast, you’ll see the curtain move
slightly, and at first you’ll think it is the air
from the open window, and then you’ll see a
bulge in the green curtain—don’t forget it’s
to be green—and then a white hand will draw
it back, and she will come stepping down out
of her frame on to the nearest chair, with her
rustling silk petticoat and her scarlet high-heeled
shoes. Perhaps that’s how she’ll come.
I only say “perhaps,” mind. Because, of
course, you might meet her in the wood, or in
some scene of gay revelry, or in the Wonderful
Garden itself—her garden, which is kept just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
as she planted it. There’s an old document
your uncle’s been showing me—she leaves
her blessing to the family so long as the
garden’s kept as it was in her time—with a
long list of the flowers and a plan of the garden
with the proper places for the flowers all
marked. Did you know that? No? I must
get your uncle to show you. I should think
she would be very likely to appear in the
garden.’</p>

<p>‘You’re not kidding us?’ Charles asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>‘Could you think it of me? No, I see you
couldn’t. You try my spell, and write and
tell me how it works. All right, Davenant—coming.
Where’s my hat?—oh, outside,
yes—and my umbrella, right. Good-bye, all
of you. Thank you very much for a most
delightful day.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ said Caroline, and they all
said, ‘Good-bye, and come again soon!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t forget green!’ were this amiable
gentleman’s parting words as he climbed into
the dogcart beside William and waved a cheery
farewell with his umbrella to the party at the
front door (at the side).</p>

<p>Uncle Charles, when the matter was laid
before him, raised no objection to the curtaining
of the picture. He even drove with them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a><br /><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a><br /><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
Maidstone and bought a special curtain for the
purpose, soft, wide, green woollen stuff it was,
very soft, very wide, very green. Mrs. Wilmington
hemmed the curtain, and the Uncle
himself, tottering on the housemaid’s steps,
hung the curtain in place.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 390px;">
<img src="images/i_390.jpg" width="390" height="597" alt="Covering the portrait" />
<div class="caption">‘Take your last look,’ he said.</div>
</div>

<p>‘Take your last look,’ he said, coming down
the steps and holding the green curtain aside
so that Dame Eleanour looked out of the dusk
of the curtain almost as if she were alive.
‘Take a good look at her, so that you will
know her again if you do see her.’</p>

<p>‘“If”?’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘I mean when,’ said the Uncle, letting the
long straight folds of the curtain fall into place.</p>

<p>The question of garlands now occupied all
thoughts, even those of the Uncle’s.</p>

<p>‘Arbor vitæ,’ said he, ‘means tree of life.’</p>

<p>‘Then we’ll have that,’ said Caroline,
‘especially as it means “unchanging friendship,”
too.’ She thought of Rupert. ‘I hope
Rupert’s back before she appears,’ she added;
‘<i>that</i> would make him believe in magic,
wouldn’t it?’</p>

<p>The Uncle, for the first time, was introduced
to the <i>Language Of</i>, and he seemed
much struck by the literary style of that
remarkable work.</p>

<p>‘“Never did the florographist select from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
cunning Nature’s wonderous field a more
appropriate interpreter of man’s innermost
passions than when he chose the arbor vitæ
to formulate the significance, ‘Live for me.’”
I was not aware that human beings <i>could</i>
write like that,’ he said, ‘and I thought you
said arbor vitæ meant something quite
different.’</p>

<p>‘They often do,’ said Caroline. ‘We used
to think the book didn’t know its own mind,
but we think now it put in new meanings when
it found them out. It’s rather confusing at
first. But “live for me” is fine. It’s just
what we want the picture to do, isn’t it?
What else?’</p>

<p>‘I leave it to you,’ said the Uncle, laying
down the book. ‘Your author’s style is too
attractive. I could waste all the rest of the
daylight on him. Farewell. If I can be
of any assistance in hanging the garlands,
let me know.’</p>

<p>They thanked him warmly and hesitated.
Then Charles said, ‘It was us that she was to
come alive to, so I expect it had better be us to
hang the garlands.’</p>

<p>‘We,’ said the Uncle gently, ‘not us.’</p>

<p>‘But I meant us,’ said Charles. ‘Not we
with you in it.’</p>

<p>‘I was trying to correct your grammar, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
your statement,’ said the Uncle; ‘but never
mind. Good-bye.’</p>

<p>Nobody was quite sure what a garland was,
because in books people sometimes wore garlands
on their heads, when of course they would
be wreaths, and sometimes twined them round
pillars, in which case they would be like Christmas
decorations.</p>

<p>‘We had better have both kinds,’ said
Caroline, ‘to be quite sure.’</p>

<p>On a foundation of twigs of the arbor vitæ,
twined round with Jaeger wool originally bought
for Caroline to knit a vest for her Aunt
Emmeline (‘but I know I shall never finish it,’
she said), symbolic flowers were tied, some in
circlets or wreaths, others on long straight
lengths. ‘Rye grass which means “a changeable
disposition,”’ was suggested by Charlotte,
‘because we do want her to change: from paint
to alive,’ she said; ‘and pink verbena means
“family reunion,” and she is a relation, after
all. Besides pink’s such a pretty colour.’</p>

<p>Caroline ascertained that yew meant life;
but Charles was considered to have made the
hit of the afternoon by his discovery that
Jacob’s ladder meant ‘come down,’ which was,
of course, exactly what they wanted the lady
to do.</p>

<p>The gardener knew what Jacob’s ladder was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
though the children did not; and their fear
that it might be a dull shrub with invisible
flowers was dispelled when they beheld its
blue brightness.</p>

<p>‘We ought to wear coronilla ourselves,’
said Caroline—‘a new piece every day. It
means “success attend your wishes.”’ But the
gardener had not heard of coronilla. ‘The book
says it’s “a flowering shrub of the pea family,”’
Caroline read from the <i>Language Of</i>, which, as
usual, she had been carrying under her arm,
‘“with small pinnate leaves”—whatever they
are. “An elegant bush with reddish-brown
blossoms when first expanded, varying to
yellow at a later period of their graceful
existence.”’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that!’ said the gardener, ‘that’ll be
scorpion’s senna. That’s what that be.
Something to do with the shape of the stars
in the sky. Old women sells it for a charm for
shy sweethearts.’</p>

<p>‘In our book it says, “Success crown your
wishes.”’</p>

<p>‘Just so,’ said the gardener, ‘and she names
the day. That’s it, along there.’</p>

<p>The garlands looked very handsome and the
wreaths very beautiful. It was Caroline who
made this distinction. And their dark foliage
and the bright pink and blue and yellow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
their flowers showed charmingly against the
green curtain.</p>

<p>‘And now,’ said Caroline, ‘we’ve just got
to wait, and Charlotte and I must stick to our
glove and handkerchief cases if they’re going
to be ready to go in time for mother’s birthday.
And, Charles, if I were you, I should get Mr.
Penfold to show you chip-carving like he
offered to, and do a box for her. And we
mustn’t forget that we’re not to look behind the
curtain.’</p>

<p>‘I shan’t forget that,’ said Charlotte.
‘What I should like to forget’s my head. It
feels twice its proper size.’</p>

<p>‘I’ve got a headache too,’ said Caroline.
‘I expect it’s the sun.’</p>

<p>‘If it was the sun, mine would ache too,’
said Charles, ‘but with me it’s the nose. I’ve
had four hankies since breakfast; and one of
those was the Wilmington’s.’</p>

<p>‘Well, let’s go and get on with our embroidery.
All my silks are frightfully tangled.’</p>

<p>They were not disentangled that day. The
headaches were worse. I will not dwell on the
development of the catastrophe. The doctor
put it in a few brief, well-chosen words the
next day:</p>

<p>‘The girls have got measles right enough,
and the boy hasn’t yet.’</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>THE END</small></h2>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> see the tragedy? Measles, with Lord
Andore’s party and Rupert’s return both fixed
for the week after next. No words of mine
could do justice to the feelings of the three
C.’s. I think, perhaps, on the whole, it was
worse for Charles, who was suspected throughout
of impending measles, of which he was
wholly innocent, his cold being only a rather
violent example of the everyday kind. He was
kept out of draughts and taken for walks by
Mrs. Wilmington and not allowed to bathe,
and he became bored beyond description.
Really the girls were better off in bed, with a
brightening vista of jelly, beef tea, fish, chicken,
leading to natural beef and pudding and getting
up to breakfast.</p>

<p>When the three were reunited it was the
very day of Lord Andore’s party, and of course
they were not allowed to go, ‘for fear of chills.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
Charles, after tea had been taken away, shut
the dining-room door carefully and said:</p>

<p>‘I’ve got something to confess.’</p>

<p>‘Well?’ said the others, as he stopped
short, and displayed no intention of ever going
on.</p>

<p>‘I don’t suppose you’ll ever care to speak to
me again when I’ve told you.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t be a copy-cat,’ said Charlotte sharply.
‘If you’ve done anything really, say so. You
know we’ll stand by you,’ she added more
kindly.</p>

<p>‘Well, then,’ said Charles, ‘I’m very sorry;
and I do hope it hasn’t spoiled the whole show;
but you don’t know how fed up I was with
being alone, and the Wilmington fussing, and
the Uncle never out of his books for more than
a minute at a time. And I did it one day
when I felt I couldn’t bear anything another
minute.’</p>

<p>‘Did what, dear?’ said Caroline, trying to
be patient.</p>

<p>‘Looked behind the curtain,’ said Charles
miserably.</p>

<p>‘I <i>knew</i> you would,’ said Charlotte; ‘at least
I mean I should have known if I’d thought of
it. It’s exactly like you, and I’ll never do
any magic with you again.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes,’ said Charles, ‘rub it in.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I expect it <i>has</i> spoiled it all,’ said Caroline.
‘Oh, Charles, how could you?’</p>

<p>‘I’m much more sorry than you are,’ said
Charles wretchedly, ‘because the magic had
begun. She’d gone out of the frame.’</p>

<p>‘Gone!’ said the girls together.</p>

<p>‘Quite gone. It was all black behind the
curtain. She wasn’t there.’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure?’</p>

<p>‘Certain sure.’</p>

<p>Both girls sprang towards the curtain, and
both stopped short as Charles hastily grabbed
an arm of each.</p>

<p>‘Don’t!’ he said; ‘you wait. I’ve thought
about it a lot. I haven’t had anything else
to do, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Poor old Charles!’ said Charlotte. ‘I’m sorry
I scratched, but it is aggravating, now isn’t it?’</p>

<p>‘Not for you it isn’t,’ said Charles. ‘You
haven’t looked behind the curtain. You
haven’t broken <i>your</i> part of the magic. It’s
all right for <i>you</i>. You’ll see her right enough.
It’s me that won’t. You’re all right.’</p>

<p>‘But I expect your looking broke the spell
and she’s back again,’ said Caroline, reaching
out a hand to the curtain.</p>

<p>‘Don’t!’ shrieked Charles, ‘the spell didn’t
break. It went on. Because I looked again
to see if it had. And she wasn’t there.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>‘How often have you looked?’ Caroline
asked severely.</p>

<p>‘Every day since,’ said Charles in a low voice.</p>

<p>‘And when did you look first?’</p>

<p>‘The day you went to bed,’ said Charles in
a still lower voice. ‘She wasn’t there then,
and she isn’t there now. Oh, don’t rag me
about it. I shan’t see her. That’s jolly well
enough, <i>I</i> should think, without you going on
at me.’</p>

<p>‘We won’t,’ said Caroline heroically, and
turned her back on the picture. ‘But you
won’t look again, will you, Charles?’</p>

<p>‘I shan’t want to, now you’ve come back,’
he said. And this compliment quite melted
the hearts of his sisters. Nothing more was
said of Charles’s unjustifiable indiscretion.</p>

<p>The next day the Uncle asked Caroline
if she and Charlotte would care to dust the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Wilmington’s going to Lord Andore’s
fête,’ he said, ‘and she is very busy.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilmington gave them the key and
they dusted with earnest care and thoroughness.
Charles tried to help, but he was not
an expert performer with the duster. More
to his mind was the watching of the mandarin’s
old slow nod, his painted smile, his crossed
china hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Oh, to think that the Wilmington’s going,
and the Mineral woman, and Rupert, and everybody
but us,’ wailed Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Never mind,’ said Caroline; ‘there’s the
Flower of Heart’s Desire to look forward to,
and Rupert coming back. And think of all
the grapes Lord Andore sent us, and the
chocks from Mr. Alphabet.’</p>

<p>She began to move the old silk handkerchief—Mrs.
Wilmington considered the drawing-room
too sacred for anything but silk—across
the marble of a big console table, when
she saw that something lay on it which was
not usually there. It was a square thing like
a letter, fastened with a sort of plaited ribbon
of green and white silk and sealed; and on
the end of the ribbon, which hung down about
three inches, was another large green seal.</p>

<p>‘Look here, Char, how funny!’ said Caroline.
‘It looks awfully old. Written on vellum or
something, and the seal’s uncle’s coat of arms.’</p>

<p>‘Let’s take it to uncle,’ Charlotte suggested.
‘Why, what’s up?’</p>

<p>Caroline was holding the letter out to her
in a hand that shook.</p>

<p>‘Look!’ she said, and her voice shook too.
‘Look! the thing’s <i>got our names on it</i>.’</p>

<p>It had. On the square parchment face
were the three names written in a strange yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
readable handwriting, in ink that was faded as
with the slow fading of many many years.</p>

<p class="center">
To<br />
Caroline,<br />
Charlotte, and<br />
Charles.<br />
</p>

<p>‘You open it, Caro,’ said Charlotte; and
Charles, who had come across from his favourite
mandarin, said, ‘Yes, Caro; you open it.’</p>

<p>It seemed a pity to break the green seals,
and they were glad that the plaited silk slipped
off easily when the letter was folded a little.
But the second green seal had to be broken.
The parchment, crackling in Caroline’s uncertain
hands, was unfolded, and within was
writing—lines in that same strange but clear
hand, that same dim, faded ink.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At eight of the clock, lean on this marble table
and gaze in the mirror and you shall see and speak
with me. But look only in the mirror, uttering no
word, and wear the pink verbena stuck behind your
ears and the roses on your hearts.—Your kinswoman,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Eleanour</span>.<br />
</p></div>

<p>‘Then I didn’t spoil it,’ Charles spoke first;
‘not even for myself. Because it’s addressed
to me the same as to you.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Caroline; ‘you’d better be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
between us two, though, Charles, and you
<i>must not</i> look round.’</p>

<p>‘As if I should think of doing such a thing,’
said Charles indignantly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At five minutes to eight that evening the
three C.’s stood in front of the console table
with pink verbena behind their ears and red
roses over their hearts. Mrs. Wilmington had
‘done’ the vases in the dining-room that very
morning, and curiously enough, roses and pink
verbena were the flowers she had chosen.</p>

<p>‘It must be a strong magic to have made
her do <i>that</i>,’ said Charlotte; ‘secrecy and family
reunion.’</p>

<p>The room was not dark, of course, at that
time in the evening, but then it was not quite
light either.</p>

<p>The three C.’s, Charles occupying a guarded
position in the middle, stood quite still and
waited.</p>

<p>And presently, quite surely and certainly,
with no nonsense about it, they saw in the
looking-glass the door open that led to the
Uncle’s secret staircase. And through it, in
trailing velvet, came a lady—the lady of the
picture. Her ruff, her coif, her darkly flashing
jewels, her softly flashing eyes,—the children
knew them well. Had they not seen them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
every day for weeks, framed in the old carved
frame in the dining-room.</p>

<p>I am sorry to say that Charles at once tried
to look round, but his sisters’ arms round his
neck restrained him.</p>

<p>The lady glided to a spot from which she
could look straight into the mirror and into the
children’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘I am here,’ she said, in what Charlotte said
afterwards was a starry voice. ‘Do not move
or speak. I have come to you because you
have believed in the old and beautiful things.
You sought for my books and found them;
also you have tried to use the magic spells to
help the poor and needy, and to reconcile them
who are at strife. Therefore you see what you
desired to see, and when the flowering time is
here, you shall have your heart’s desire. Do
not speak or move lest you break the spell.
I will sing to you. And when the last note
dies away, close your eyes and count very
slowly twenty-seven—the number of the years
on earth of your kinswoman Eleanour.’</p>

<p>The beautiful presence moved along the
room to the harp, that too was in the field of
vision bounded by the tarnished gold of the
mirror’s frame. She seated herself on a chair
of faded needlework and drew the golden harp
towards her. Then she sang softly in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
starry voice that was hers in speaking. The
song was in a language that none of them knew
(Charles said afterwards that it was Latin), but
it was not like any Latin the girls had ever
heard. And the music was starry too. And
the meaning of the song seemed to be love and
parting and hope and noble dreams and the
desire of great and good things; a song that
made one very happy and yet made one feel as
though one must cry. Softer and softer the
voice grew, softer and softer the gentle,
resonant tones of the harp. The song ended.</p>

<p>‘Now,’ said the lady, ‘farewell!’</p>

<p>The children closed their eyes, Caroline put
her hand over Charles’s to ‘make sure,’ and
so moved was he by the singing and the
beautiful mystery of the whole adventure, that
he hardly wriggled at all. There was a soft
rustling sound behind them. Very slowly
they all counted from one to twenty-seven.
Caroline’s hand was clasping Charlotte’s, and
at the end of the count a long pressure, returned,
told each that the other had finished
her counting.</p>

<p>They opened their eyes, turned round.
The drawing-room was empty. It seemed
impossible. Yet it was true.</p>

<p>‘It’s all over,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘But we’ve seen Her,’ said Caroline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>‘We’ve heard Her,’ said Charlotte.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Charles, ‘I intend to be perfectly
good every minute, as long as I live. I wish
Rupert had been here. He would never have
done anything wrong again either, like he did
when——’</p>

<p>‘It’s very wrong,’ Charlotte interrupted, ‘to
remember things other people have done
wrong. Come on, let’s go back to the dining-room.
It’s lonely here without Her.’</p>

<p>They went back to the dining-room and sat
talking the great mystery over, almost in
whispers, till it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p>‘And to-morrow we’re to go out,’ were
Charlotte’s last words. ‘And the F. of H.D.
ought to be flowering. It’s just seven weeks
since we sowed it.’</p>

<p>‘Of course it is,’ said Caroline; ‘don’t talk
as if you were the only one who remembered
it. I say, if you had to say what your heart’s
desire would be, what would it?’</p>

<p>‘To see Her again,’ said Charlotte, ‘and
hear her starry voice.’</p>

<p>Next morning there was a discussion about
the curtain the moment the three entered the
dining-room. Ought they, or ought they not
to remove the curtain. The girls were for
leaving it, and putting up fresh garlands every
day as long as they stayed in the Manor House.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
But Charles, who had faithfully put fresh
flowers, not always garlanded, it is true, but
always flowers, every day during the measle
interval, had had enough of it, and said so.</p>

<p>‘And she’s had enough of it too,’ he said;
‘it was to make her come and she came. She
won’t come again if you go on garlanding for
ever.’</p>

<p>The Uncle, for a wonder, breakfasted with
them. Charles appealed to him.</p>

<p>‘We saw her; she did come, her real self,’
he said; ‘yesterday. So the charm’s worked,
and we oughtn’t to go on garlanding, ought
we?’</p>

<p>‘You really saw her?’ the Uncle asked.
And was told many things.</p>

<p>‘Then,’ he said, when he had listened to it
all, ‘I think we might draw back the curtain.
The magic has been wrought, and now all
should be restored to its old state.’</p>

<p>‘I told you so,’ said Charles.</p>

<p>‘Shall I take down the curtain?’ said the
Uncle. And the three C.’s said ‘Yes!’</p>

<p>He pulled at the green folds, and the curtain
and drooping soft flowers of yesterday fell in
a mingled heap on the floor. And from the
frame, now disclosed, the lady’s lips almost
smiled on them as her beautiful eyes gazed
down on them with a new meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But she’ll never speak to us again,’ said
Caroline, almost in tears.</p>

<p>‘Or sing to us,’ said Charlotte, not very
steadily.</p>

<p>‘Or tell us to count twenty-seven slowly,’
said Charles, sniffing a very little.</p>

<p>‘But it’s something, isn’t it,’ said the
Uncle, ‘to have seen her, even if only for
once?’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You will understand that anything Mrs.
Wilmington might say was powerless to break
the charm of so wonderful an adventure.
Hollow tales she told of the portrait’s having
been borrowed for a show of pictures of
celebrities who had lived in the neighbourhood,
and of the picture being brought back very late
the night before, after the servants had gone
to bed; also of a gentleman who told her
that Mr. Alphabet sent his love; also of a
lady, a great actress from London, who had
taken part in the Pageant which was one of
the features of Lord Andore’s coming-of-age
party—‘a very nice lady she was, too, dressed
up to look the part of the picture, and put
down as Dame Eleanour in the programme,
which I can show you printed in silver on satin
paper.’</p>

<p>‘I daresay it’s true what the Wilmington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
says,’ said Caroline when they were alone,
‘but it doesn’t make any difference. <i>Our</i> Lady
wasn’t dressed up to look the part. She <i>was</i>
the picture. Perhaps our heart’s desire <i>will</i>
turn out to be seeing her again. Let’s go and
see if the seed has flowered.’</p>

<p>It had. In that plot of the terraced garden
which the old gardener had marked with the
pencilled slip-label, seven tall straight stems
had shot up, perfect and even in each leaf and
stalk, as every plant was which grew in that
wonderful soil. And each stem bore one only
flower, white and star-shaped, and with a strange
sweet scent.</p>

<p>‘I wish Rupert were here,’ said Charlotte.
‘We ought to wait for Rupert.’</p>

<p>And as she spoke, there was Rupert, coming
to them through the flowers of the lower
garden.</p>

<p>‘So they’ve flowered,’ he said, without any
other greeting.</p>

<p>‘Yes, and now we’re going to eat them
and get our heart’s desire. Oh, Rupert, I do
wish you believed in it all.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps I do,’ said Rupert. ‘The decent
way old Macpherson has behaved while I’ve
been there makes you ready to believe in
<i>anything</i>.’</p>

<p>‘Then let’s eat them,’ said Caroline; ‘one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
each, and the other three we’ll divide as well
as we can.’</p>

<p>Each plucked a white starry blossom. The
stalks snapped off clean and fresh like primrose
stalks. Then the four put each a hand on the
stalk of the fifth flower and broke it between
them. And so with the sixth and the seventh.
Caroline divided the three flowers with extreme
care and accuracy and handed its share to each
child. Then, standing in a ring in the sunny
garden, the four ate the white flowers. The
taste of them was pleasant but strange, something
like pineapple and something like flower-artichokes
(which have the most mysterious
taste in the world)—something like spice and
something like the fruit you eat in dreams.</p>

<p>And as they finished eating they heard a
foot on the steps of the terrace and turned,
and it was the Uncle, coming towards them
with pale-coloured papers in one hand and a
bunch of waxy white flowers in the other.</p>

<p>Fond as all were of Uncle Charles, no one
could feel that the moment was fortunately
chosen, and I am sorry to say that Charles
voiced to some extent the general feeling
when he said almost audibly, ‘Oh, bother!’</p>

<p>The Uncle came towards them smiling
kindly.</p>

<p>‘I have come,’ he said, ‘to make a presentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
to you.’ He gave to each a white flower.
‘I have again consulted that entrancing volume
of yours, <i>The Language of Flowers</i>, and it tells
me that this is the appropriate flower to convey
the sentiments with which I approach you.’</p>

<p>Every one said, ‘Thank you very much.’
And Caroline added, ‘But what does it mean,
Uncle?’</p>

<p>‘What? Has your book taught you so
little?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ Caroline kindly explained, ‘I
don’t even know what the name of the flower
is, but it’s most awfully kind of you, uncle,
all the same.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, the name of the flower?’ said the
Uncle. ‘It’s stephanotis.’</p>

<p>‘But that means, “Will you accompany me
to the East?”’ said Caroline.</p>

<p>‘Well,’ said the Uncle, ‘and will you?’</p>

<p>‘To the East?’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said the Uncle; ‘let us sit down on
the steps and talk over the idea.’</p>

<p>They sat down and the Uncle explained.</p>

<p>‘Your finding those books,’ he said, ‘has
so completely revolutionised my ideas of magic
that I cannot complete my book. I must
throw it into the melting-pot, rewrite it
entirely. And to do that I need more knowledge
than I have. And I intend to travel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
to examine the magic of other lands. The
first country I shall visit is India, and it
occurred to me that you might like to go
with me and visit your parents. I have been
corresponding with them by cable,’ he added,
waving the pale-coloured papers, ‘and your
parents are delighted with the idea of the
family reunion (pink verbena). We start, if
the idea smiles to you, next week.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, uncle!’ was all that any one could find
to say, till Charlotte added, ‘But what about
Rupert?’</p>

<p>‘Rupert is to go too,’ said the Uncle, ‘as far
as Suez, where his father will meet him.’</p>

<p>‘Is father coming home, then?’ Rupert
asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>‘For a year’s leave,’ said the Uncle. ‘But
you haven’t any of you answered the stephanotis
question yet. Will you accompany me to the
East?’</p>

<p>Caroline ran to a flower-bed and came back
with some leaves and flowers which she thrust
into the Uncle’s hand.</p>

<p>‘Small white bell-flower, wood sorrel,
aquilegia,’ she said; ‘they mean perfect joy;
we love you beyond measure; and Yes. Yes!
Yes!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As they turned to go to the house they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
the seven stems on which the white starry
flowers had grown, and suddenly and surely
each child saw that the Uncle, when he brought
them the bunch of pale papers in one hand
and the bunch of stephanotis in the other, was
really bringing to each child its Heart’s Desire.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
